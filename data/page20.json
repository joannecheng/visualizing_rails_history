is a duplicate of #8718, made against master in preparation for merging. /cc @rafaelfranca\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes a bug introduced in 96a13fc7 which breaks behaviour of\r\ninteger fields.\r\n\r\nIn 3.2.8, setting the value of an integer field to a non-integer (eg.\r\nArray, Hash, etc.) would default to 1 (true) :\r\n\r\n    # 3.2.8\r\n    p = Post.new\r\n    p.category_id = [ 1, 2 ]\r\n    p.category_id # => 1\r\n    p.category_id = { 3 => 4 }\r\n    p.category_id # => 1\r\n\r\nIn 3.2.9 and above, this will raise a NoMethodError :\r\n\r\n    # 3.2.9\r\n    p = Post.new\r\n    p.category_id = [ 1, 2 ]\r\n\r\n    NoMethodError: undefined method `to_i' for [1, 2]:Array\r\n\r\nWhilst at first blush this appear to be sensible, it combines in bad\r\nways with scoping.\r\n\r\nFor example, it is common to use scopes to control access to data :\r\n\r\n    @collection = Posts.where(:category_id => [ 1, 2 ])\r\n    @new_post = @collection.new\r\n\r\nIn 3.2.8, this would work as expected, creating a new Post object\r\n(albeit with @new_post.category_id = 1). However, in 3.2.9 this will\r\ncause the NoMethodError to be raised as above.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to avoid triggering this error without descoping before\r\ncalling .new, breaking any apps running on 3.2.8 that rely on this\r\nbehaviour.\r\n\r\nThis patch deviates from 3.2.8 in that it does not retain the somewhat\r\nspurious behaviour of setting the attribute to 1. Instead, it explicitly\r\nsets these invalid values to nil :\r\n\r\n    p = Post.new\r\n    p.category_id = [ 1, 2 ]\r\n    p.category_id # => nil\r\n\r\nThis also fixes the situation where a scope using an array will\r\n\"pollute\" any newly instantiated records.\r\n\r\n    @new_post = @collection.new\r\n    @new_post.category_id # => nil\r\n\r\nFinally, 3.2.8 exhibited a behaviour where setting an object to an\r\ninteger field caused it to be coerced to \"1\". This has not been\r\nretained, as it is spurious and surprising in the same way that setting\r\nArrays and Heshes was :\r\n\r\n    c = Category.find(6)\r\n    p = Post.new\r\n\r\n    # 3.2.8\r\n    p.category_id = c\r\n    p.category_id # => 1\r\n\r\n    # This patch\r\n    p.category_id = c\r\n    p.category_id # => nil\r\n\r\nThis commit includes explicit test cases that expose the original issue\r\nwith calling new on a scope that uses an Array. As this is a common\r\nsituation, an explicit test case is the best way to prevent regressions\r\nin the future.\r\n\r\nIt also updates and separates existing tests to be explicit about the\r\nsituation that is being tested (eg. AR objects vs. other objects

commit fixes a bug introduced in 96a13fc7 which breaks behaviour of\r\ninteger fields in 3.2.8.\r\n\r\nIn 3.2.8, setting the value of an integer field to a non-integer (eg.\r\nArray, Hash, etc.) would use the first value in the array :\r\n\r\n    # 3.2.8\r\n    p = Post.new\r\n    p.category_id = [ 1, 2 ]\r\n    p.category_id # => 1\r\n    p.category_id = { 1 => 2 }\r\n    p.category_id # => 1\r\n\r\nIn 3.2.9 and above, this will raise a NoMethodError :\r\n\r\n    # 3.2.9\r\n    p = Post.new\r\n    p.category_id = [ 1, 2 ]\r\n\r\n    NoMethodError: undefined method `to_i' for [1, 2]:Array\r\n\r\nWhilst at first blush this appear to be sensible, it combines in bad\r\nways with scoping.\r\n\r\nFor example, it is common to use scopes to control access to data :\r\n\r\n    @collection = Posts.where(:category_id => [ 1,2 ])\r\n    @new_post = @collection.new\r\n\r\nIn 3.2.8, this would work as expected, creating a new Post object\r\n(albeit with `@new_post.category_id = 1`). However, in 3.2.9 this will\r\ncause the NoMethodError to be raised as above.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to avoid triggering this error without descoping before\r\ncalling `.new`, breaking any apps running on 3.2.8 that rely on this\r\nbehaviour.\r\n\r\nThis patch deviates from 3.2.8 in that it does not retain the somewhat\r\nspurious behaviour of setting the attribute to the first element or key.\r\nInstead, it explicitly sets these invalid values to nil :\r\n\r\n    p = Post.new\r\n    p.category_id = [ 1, 2 ]\r\n    p.category_id # => nil\r\n\r\nThis also fixes the situation where a scope using an array will\r\n\"pollute\" any newly instantiated records.\r\n\r\n    @new_post = @collection.new\r\n    @new_post.category_id # => nil\r\n\r\nFinally, 3.2.8 exhibited a behaviour where setting an object to an\r\ninteger field caused it to be coerced to \"1\".

allows you to skip callbacks that are defined by objects, e.g. for `ActionController`:\r\n\r\n    skip_after_filter MySpecialFilter\r\n\r\nPreviously this didn't work due to a bug in how Rails compared callbacks in `Callback#matches?`. When a callback is compiled, if it's an object filter (i.e. not a method, proc, etc.), `Callback` now defines a method on `@klass` that is derived from the class name rather than `@callback_id`. So, when `skip_callback` tries to find the appropriate callback to remove, `Callback` can regenerate the method name for the filter object and return the correct value for `Callback#matches?`.","created_at":"2013-01-02T12:31:14Z","updated_at":"2013-07-05T13:21:06Z","closed_at":"2013-04-01T19:13:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9e99e31fb5613084ddbca6b4b13bef0c9a22790e","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8687/commits","review_comments_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8687/comments","review_comment_url":"/repos/rails/rails/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/8687/comments","head":{"label":"benmcredmond:fix_skipping_object_callbacks","ref":"fix_skipping_object_callbacks","sha":"16c5c558218efd25caf2850ee552459ad1867331","user":{"login":"benmcredmond","id":83981,"avatar_url":"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/873dc46aca0261e0a60ebf75f6e10f26?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F62b7ada1994288382a66b6ef184f864b.png","gravatar_id":"873dc46aca0261e0a60ebf75f6e10f26","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmcredmond","html_url":"https://github.com/benmcredmond","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmcredmond/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmcredmond/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmcredmond/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmcredmond/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmcredmond/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmcredmond/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmcredmond/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmcredmond/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmcredmond/received_events","type":"User"},"repo":{"id":7406141,"name":"rails","full_name":"benmcredmond/rails","owner":{"login":"benmcredmond","id":83981,"avatar_url":"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/873dc46aca0261e0a60ebf75f6e10f26?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F62b7ada1994288382a66b6ef184f864b.png","gravatar_id":"873dc46aca0261e0a60ebf75f6e10f26","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmcredmond","html_url":"https://github.com/benmcredmond","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmcredmond/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmcredmond/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmcredmond/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmcredmond/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmcredmond/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmcredmond/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmcredmond/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmcredmond/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmcredmond/received_events","type":"User"},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/benmcredmond/rails","description":"Ruby

source issue is: #8672\r\n\r\nThis PR is only a failing test case as I am not completely sure how to tackle the problem.\r\n\r\nI investigated and can confirm that the order in which `after_create` and `has_and_belongs_to_many` associations are defined does impact the functionality.\r\n\r\nIf the callback is defined before the association every HABTM record created inside the callback will be inserted twice. The reason is `AutosaveAssociation#save_collection_association`. It will pick up the already created records and save them again. This happens because `@new_record_before_save` will be true and since it's an `after_create` callback, the associations are inserted directly with `<<`.\r\n\r\nMy test case results in the following failure:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  1) Failure:\r\ntest_after_create_before_habtm_definition(HasAndBelongsToManyAssociationsTest)

currently generates gzipped javascript and css files next to their uncompressed counterparts. However, to take advantage of this you need to use an nginx extension or something similar.\r\n\r\nThis patch will allow ActionDispatch::Static to serve up these gzipped files when appropriate.\r\n\r\nFor example, this request:\r\n\r\n    curl -H \"Accept-Encoding: gzip\" http://localhost:3000/assets/application.js\r\n\r\nWill look for application.js.gz on disk and respond with:\r\n\r\n     HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n     Content-Type: application/javascript\r\n     Content-Encoding: gzip\r\n     Content-Length: 1234\r\n     More-Headers...\r\n\r\n     <compressed data>\r\n\r\nThis is particularly helpful for environments like Heroku, that depend on ActionDispatch::Static to serve static assets. Currently, the only way to serve gzipped assets in this environment is to install Rack::Deflate ahead of ActionDispatch::Static. This is undesirable, because Rack::Deflate compresses everything, including compressed assets like images and swfs.","created_at":"2013-01-01T02:42:59Z","updated_at":"2013-07-21T21:41:59Z","closed_at":"2013-02-21T19:44:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a2e20e25b82c47328904690a9e5fd71f2bb28d50","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8669/commits","review_comments_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8669/comments","review_comment_url":"/repos/rails/rails/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/8669/comments","head":{"label":"jbaudanza:master","ref":"master","sha":"a600cffa20be647137af07d72b3dd5803de4325d","user":{"login":"jbaudanza","id":35914,"avatar_url":"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/059463476276884f7bc88b1c10f8320b?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fa5593d9c8b76cb79cf9da320681c6c25.png","gravatar_id":"059463476276884f7bc88b1c10f8320b","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaudanza","html_url":"https://github.com/jbaudanza","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaudanza/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaudanza/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaudanza/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaudanza/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaudanza/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaudanza/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaudanza/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaudanza/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaudanza/received_events","type":"User"},"repo":{"id":7392575,"name":"rails","full_name":"jbaudanza/rails","owner":{"login":"jbaudanza","id":35914,"avatar_url":"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/059463476276884f7bc88b1c10f8320b?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fa5593d9c8b76cb79cf9da320681c6c25.png","gravatar_id":"059463476276884f7bc88b1c10f8320b","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaudanza","html_url":"https://github.com/jbaudanza","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaudanza/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaudanza/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaudanza/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaudanza/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaudanza/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaudanza/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaudanza/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaudanza/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaudanza/received_events","type":"User"},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/jbaudanza/rails","description":"Ruby

have a class called `RoutesInspector`. It's purpose is to aggregate the routes so that they can be displayed in the console (`rake routes`). Recently a routes listing was added to the exception page. This listing used parts of `RoutesInspector` but since the class was intermingled with formatting logic for the console, only parts could be reused. This led to #8649.\r\n\r\nTo solve this I did:\r\n\r\n1. split the formatting logic and `RoutesInspector`.\r\n1. when formatting a filter can be applied. We did not have test coverage for the filter argument, so I added a small test case.\r\n1. The `RoutesInspector` now holds the routes it operates on as an instance variable. This allows to instantiate the inspector but apply the formatting later (when we don't have access to the routes anymore).\r\n1. use the same code path to aggregate routes for the console and the web (only the formatter is different).\r\n1. I noticed that there was no test, that rendered the routes table on the exception page. This could lead to embarrassing errors. I added such a test to make sure we don't have any obvious errors. \r\n\r\nThis fixes

With this commit, you can now do that.\r\n\r\nI've typed these commands enough times over the years and ended up with empty migrations that I finally decided to add them to Rails and see if anyone else considered it useful.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n    rails g migration create_posts title:string\r\nor\r\n    \r\n    rails g migration CreatePosts title:string\r\n\r\nThis commit also moves the template the model generator uses for the migration to the migration templates folder, as it seems a more sensible place for it now that it is shared

is a follow up to: #8636\r\n\r\nWhen a table or a column is renamed related indexes kept their name. This will lead to confusing names. This patch renames related indexes when a column or a table is renamed. Only indexes with names generated by rails will be renamed. Indexes with custom names will not be renamed.\r\n\r\nI performed the following operations:\r\n\r\n1.  renamed argument `name` to `table_name` in `#rename_table` (PostgreSQL and SQLite). I changed the name to make it consistent across the adapters and the API\r\n1. `rename_table_indexes` and `rename_column_indexes` are available to rename related indexes. These methods are called from the individual adapters. I modified SQLite, MySQL and PostgreSQL\r\n\r\nI noticed that the method to generated the name of an index is order dependent. This means that `index_name` will return a different name when the columns are passed in different order:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nindex_name('articles', :column => ['a', 'b']) != index_name('articles', :column => ['b', 'a'])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was problematic when implementing the rename for multi-column indexes. It works at the moment but the order dependent code could lead to indexes not being renamed. I would like to sort the columns before generating the name but this would have a bad impact on backwards compatibility because rails would generate different index names. Any

) Is it intentional that the first two lines in this test are the same? If so, what is the purpose?\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n      def test_change_type_of_not_null_column\r\n        change_column \"test_models\", \"updated_at\", :datetime, :null => false\r\n        change_column \"test_models\", \"updated_at\", :datetime, :null => false\r\n        change_column \"test_models\", \"updated_at\", :datetime, :null => true\r\n      end\r\n```\r\n2.) the FIXME in `rename_column` said: \"we should test that the index goes away\". Should the index go away when we rename? Currently it stays as is. Should the index be renamed if the name was generated by rails?\r\n\r\n3.) the FIXME in `test_remove_column_with_multi_column_index` said: \"we should test that the index goes away\". Currently only PostgreSQL drops the index. Both MySQL and SQLite keep the index. Should I write the test for postgres

the discussion and all the concerns on 61b91c4c55bcbd5a2ec85d6e1c67755150653dff, it seems like it's not a good idea to make people add `./bin` to their source control.\r\n\r\nIf we really would like to promote the usage of binstubs, we should instead coordinate with Bundler and find a better solution, such as a shared configuration that enable binstubs generation when user running `bundle install` locally, since it's now a de-facto that a developer would run `bundle install` after they clone a project.\r\n\r\nThis partially reverts commit

my app I use STI and overridden table_name but `habtm` in it doesn't work properly, and I have to set options on it forcibly. I'll show you example:\r\n```ruby\r\nmodule Namespace\r\n  class Base < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n    self.table_name = 'tablename'\r\n    has_and_belongs_to_many :somethings\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Namespace::Child < Namespace::Base\r\nend\r\n```\r\nIt gives me advantage I can keep all these stuff inside `namespace` directory and it will be auto loaded by AS and it's still STI. But HABTM relies on classes when it calculates table names, so for join table it chooses `bases_somethings` instead of `tablename_somethings`. Of course I can set these options manually and it will work. I left comment in this PR and it has small refactoring proposed by @jonleighton in comment and actually this refactoring is the way to go if we want to use

source was this issue #8264\r\n\r\n### the problem\r\n\r\nWhen creating an index the length is verified against the database limit. This allows you to create an index with a name that uses up all available characters.\r\n\r\nWe have internal operations, which rely on prefixing the index to circumvent name collisions. These internal functions will fail when dealing with long indices (`prefix + index name > database limit`).\r\n\r\n### proposed solution\r\n\r\nI see two possible solutions.\r\n\r\n1. We can get rid of the internal functionality that relies on prefixing\r\n1. We reserve a range of characters, which rails can use to perform transformations\r\n\r\nSince I'm not sure what impact 1.) would have and if it is even possible I did a draft of 2.)\r\n\r\n### up for discussion\r\n\r\nThere are already methods, which hold the maximum allows characters for index names, column names, table names, etc.. (`index_name_length`, `column_name_length`, `table_name_length`). I'm not sure if we should subtract the reserved character count directly from these lengths.\r\n\r\n* + If we subtract the reserved count directly we need much fewer modifications\r\n* - we loose the actual database limit\r\n\r\nCurrently I only applied the changes to the index names. I think table names and possible column names are affected as well.\r\n\r\n### current solution\r\n\r\nSome adapter (SQLite3) need to perform renaming operations to support the rails DDL. These rename prefixes operate with prefixes. When an index name already uses up the full space provieded by `index_name_length` these internal operations will fail. This patch introduces `allowed_index_name_length` which respects the amount of characters used for internal operations. It will always be <= `index_name_length` and every adapter can define how many characters need to be
