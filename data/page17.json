is now functionality which allows a user to get notifications about file system changes. The majority of this pull request creates a module which queries for file system changes using the Ruby IO classes (note that it doesn't require any C or operating system specific extensions).\r\n\r\nI've added the capability to listen for file additions, modifications, and deletions and send these on to a new notification queue. Subscribing to this queue will allow you to receive file system updates.\r\n\r\nThe Notifications module is also changed because of this. There is now a notion of the type of Notification one is subscribing to. The regular notifications are the canonical notifications that one could subscribe to in the previous code. However, there is now a filesystem notification that one can subscribe to. There is a completely separate notification queue for each type of notification.\r\n\r\nI kept the previous methods for the regular notifications intact for backwards compatibility, but I also included methods such as \"subscribe_with_type\" or \"publish_with_type\" which allows you do deal with notifications of a particular type.\r\n\r\nThe code is still in its infancy and looks pretty raw, so I'm looking forward to comments.

Problem\r\n\r\nThe problem is described in [Potential Query Manipulation with Common Rails Practises](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups=#!topic/rubyonrails-security/ZOdH5GH5jCU), which notes that \"it is not possible for ActiveRecord to automatically protect against all instances of this attack\".  However, it is possible to handle the case where the column type is known.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nUser.where(:login_token=>params[:token]).first\r\n```\r\nperforms the query\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM `users` WHERE `login_token` = 0 LIMIT 1;\r\n```\r\nwhere it will match any login_token that starts with a non-digit character.  But since active record can determine that login_token is a string type column, it can quote the integer it is being compared with as follows.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM `users` WHERE `login_token` = '0' LIMIT 1;\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich will have the desired affect of only matching the exact string '0'.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nModify the connection adapter's `quote` method to quote the numeric value as a SQL string if the column it is being compared with is known to be non-numeric.  Boolean values are represented as the integers 0 or 1 for some databases, so booleans are also quoted as SQL strings when comparing against a string type column.\r\n\r\nThe PredicateBuilder also needed to be modified to ensure that integers are quoted, since Arel treats them as literals.  Quoting the integer and passing it to Arel as a `Arel::Nodes::SqlLiteral` object will ensure that the value is not double quoted.\r\n\r\n## Limitations\r\n\r\nSQL fragments with quoted values have no information about the column type, so the following is still unsafe.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nUser.where(\"login_token = ?\", params[:token])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe parameters to the SQL fragment should still be converted to the correct type before passing it to active record as follows.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nUser.where(\"login_token = ?\",

change was introduced in rails in 7f1a666d causing the whole application cache to be cleared everytime a precompile is run, but it is not neccesary and just slows down precompiling.\r\n\r\nSecondary consequences are the clearing of the whole cache, which if using the default file cache could cause an application level performance hit.\r\n\r\nThe only benefit I can imagine is removing view fragments from the cache which may have old asset references, but this is really up to the application and how it is deployed.\r\n\r\nThis is already [fixed in sprockets-rails][sprockets-rails] for rails 4, but is a worthwhile point release patch for interim gains considering how much of a pain point this is for so many.\r\n\r\nHere's the temporary solution we're now using in our app:

do:\r\n\r\nPosts.select(:name => \"John\").order(\"id DESC\").unscope(:order) == Posts.select(:name => \"John\")\r\n\r\nThis is implemented for all methods in the ActiveRecord query interface such

testing the new cache_digest functionality of Rails 4 I ran across something that might not be a bug, but to me is unexpected behavior. Assume we have a model named Person that belongs to car with the touch functionality enabled.\r\n\r\n    car_1 = Car.create\r\n    car_2 = Car.create\r\n\r\n    person = Person.create :car_id => car_1.id\r\n\r\nAt this point car_1 gets touched as expected.\r\n\r\n    person.car = car_2\r\n    person.save\r\n\r\nAt this point car_2 gets touched as expected, but car_1 is not touched. This leads to a situation where car_1's cache will not be busted. I submit that it should.\r\n\r\nBasically when an object that belongs_to another object had a previous relationship. I think both should be touched.\r\n\r\nI don't mind writing the code for this behavior, but I wanted to get some feedback from everyone else to see if there was a reason this wasn't ever implemented, or something i'm not thinking

provides support for external connection adapters to provide their own rake task implementations. This was great news for those of us maintaining external connection adapters.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, three of the rake tasks in databases.rake still include a hard-coded gate on the adapter name. Only certain adapters (MySQL, Postgres, and Sqlite) get passed to DatabaseTasks, with the result that third party connection adapters are still locked out of providing implementations for those three tasks.\r\n\r\nThis is a small diff that removes the hard-coded adapter name check, and instead makes DatabaseTasks the default (fallback) implementation for those tasks. Therefore, now, when one of these three rake tasks are run:\r\n\r\n* For the main adapters (MySQL, Postgres, and Sqlite), this has no effect.\r\n* For third party adapters, this gives them a chance to run their code via DatabaseTasks\r\n* For \"unknown\" adapters where a rake task implementation is not provided, the behavior changes from an exception thrown out of databases.rake, to an exception thrown out of DatabaseTasks. Thus, it now matches the behavior of most of the rest of the other rake tasks.\r\n","created_at":"2013-01-30T03:32:50Z","updated_at":"2013-01-30T11:28:15Z","closed_at":"2013-01-30T11:28:00Z","merged_at":"2013-01-30T11:28:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"127d0ec7327977a148af92f3a1d4865381de1b06","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9118/commits","review_comments_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9118/comments","review_comment_url":"/repos/rails/rails/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/9118/comments","head":{"label":"dazuma:remove_adapter_names_from_databases_rake","ref":"remove_adapter_names_from_databases_rake","sha":"a374366720a42fa5720992b2f80ba72180319bc5","user":{"login":"dazuma","id":8911,"avatar_url":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/e06aa8f63d2a1753a2b352bc1cabbde2?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Ffed537780f3f29cc5d5f313bbda423c4.png","gravatar_id":"e06aa8f63d2a1753a2b352bc1cabbde2","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dazuma","html_url":"https://github.com/dazuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dazuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dazuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dazuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dazuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dazuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dazuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dazuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dazuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dazuma/received_events","type":"User"},"repo":{"id":1922343,"name":"rails","full_name":"dazuma/rails","owner":{"login":"dazuma","id":8911,"avatar_url":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/e06aa8f63d2a1753a2b352bc1cabbde2?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Ffed537780f3f29cc5d5f313bbda423c4.png","gravatar_id":"e06aa8f63d2a1753a2b352bc1cabbde2","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dazuma","html_url":"https://github.com/dazuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dazuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dazuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dazuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dazuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dazuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dazuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dazuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dazuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dazuma/received_events","type":"User"},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/dazuma/rails","description":"Ruby
