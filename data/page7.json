is #6763 squashed and rebased off the current master.\r\n\r\nTo quote @alfredw\r\n\r\n```\r\nWhen calling quote_value the underlying connection sometimes requires\r\nmore information about the column to properly return the correct quoted\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nI ran into this issue when using optimistic locking in JRuby and the\r\nactiverecord-jdbcmssql-adapter. In SQLSever 2000, we aren't allowed to\r\ninsert a integer into a NVARCHAR column type so we need to format it as\r\nN'3' if we want to insert into the NVARCHAR type. Unfortuantely, without\r\nthe column type being passed the connection adapter cannot properly return\r\nthe correct quote value because it doesn't know to return N'3' or '3'.\r\n\r\nThis patch is fairly straight forward where it just passes in the column\r\ntype into the quote_value, as it already has the ability to take in the column,\r\nso it can properly handle at the connection level.\r\n\r\nI've added the tests required to make sure that the quote_value method\r\nis being passed the column type so that the underlying connection can\r\ndetermine how to quote the

Hello!\r\n\r\nThis pull addresses a couple, but not all, issues noted here: https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/10643.\r\n\r\nCurrently, `.unscope` and `.except` do not act on the default scope. (Default scope is always applied at the end of a query. Whether or not the default scope has been applied before the end of a query chain is stored as `.default_scoped` on the relation. (`.default_scoped?` is aliased to `.default_scoped`.))\r\n\r\nGiven:\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Project < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  default_scope -> { where trashed: false }\r\nend\r\n```\r\n, the current implementations of `.unscope` and `.except` result in the following:\r\n```ruby\r\nProject.unscope(where: :trashed).to_sql\r\n#=> \"SELECT \\\"projects\\\".* FROM \\\"projects\\\"  WHERE \\\"projects\\\".\\\"trashed\\\" = 'f'\"\r\nProject.except(:where).to_sql\r\n#=> \"SELECT \\\"projects\\\".* FROM \\\"projects\\\"  WHERE \\\"projects\\\".\\\"trashed\\\" = 'f'\"\r\n```\r\nThis pull changes `.unscope` and `.except` to act on the default scope:\r\n```ruby\r\nProject.unscope(where: :trashed).to_sql\r\n#=> \"SELECT \\\"projects\\\".* FROM \\\"projects\\\"\"\r\nProject.except(:where).to_sql\r\n#=> \"SELECT \\\"projects\\\".* FROM \\\"projects\\\"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### `.unscope`\r\nThis pull executes `.unscope`'s existing code with the scope returned from `#with_default_scope`. It changes a few variable names (`scope` -> `arg` in `#unscope`, `scope` -> `clause` in `#symbol_unscoping`) to avoid confusion over the meaning of word \"scope.\"\r\n\r\n##### `.except`\r\nCurrently, `.except` returns a brand new Relation based on what's passed in and the current relation's `#values`. If any clause passed in is included in the default scope, this pull executes `.unscope` with those clauses on that relation. The spirit of `.except` seems to be *fresher* than `.unscope` in that it originally returned a brand new Relation. That is why this only calls unscope if any clauses passed in are in the default scope, rather than just calling `.unscope` with the clauses passed in.\r\n\r\nThis pull's version of `.except` queries the default scope's values. Because such values feel public, this pull adds `.default_scope_values` as a public method. Some in the core may object to its implementation because of the evolution around default scopes in general and deprecations re: eager loading default scopes in particular.\r\n\r\nThis is my first pull request to rails.

instance.","created_at":"2013-06-10T07:19:52Z","updated_at":"2013-06-18T00:38:38Z","closed_at":"2013-06-18T00:37:55Z","merged_at":"2013-06-18T00:37:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"4fe4b681442428fe5246a87b9e085eb849094267","assignee":{"login":"spastorino","id":52642,"avatar_url":"https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d04d064616ae7fd752fdcb8daa5abdd6?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F960fc72b306e2c9879dbeaa4f765dad2.png","gravatar_id":"d04d064616ae7fd752fdcb8daa5abdd6","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spastorino","html_url":"https://github.com/spastorino","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spastorino/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spastorino/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spastorino/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spastorino/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spastorino/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spastorino/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spastorino/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spastorino/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spastorino/received_events","type":"User"},"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10902/commits","review_comments_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10902/comments","review_comment_url":"/repos/rails/rails/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/10902/comments","head":{"label":"wangjohn:removing_application_singleton_calls","ref":"removing_application_singleton_calls","sha":"55d708d5974351eb64c5977d82fff0ae6cd1451f","user":{"login":"wangjohn","id":1075780,"avatar_url":"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0f072cda8c91e247b8dd76fa1b10a64e.png","gravatar_id":"ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn","html_url":"https://github.com/wangjohn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/received_events","type":"User"},"repo":{"id":7698202,"name":"rails","full_name":"wangjohn/rails","owner":{"login":"wangjohn","id":1075780,"avatar_url":"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0f072cda8c91e247b8dd76fa1b10a64e.png","gravatar_id":"ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn","html_url":"https://github.com/wangjohn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/received_events","type":"User"},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/wangjohn/rails","description":"Ruby

This would result in querying and returning IDs of all non-associated records, rather than an empty set as would be expected. \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCompany.new.contract_ids\r\n\"SELECT

`:automatic_inverse_of` in favor of using the `inverse_of: false` to tell us whether we don't want to use automatic inverses. Changing the documentation and adding a CHANGELOG entry for the automatic inverse detection feature.\r\n\r\n@jonleighton I don't think it's actually possible to use `inverse_of: nil` to tell us to not automatically find inverse associations. This is because the feature would be completely useless, since by default, we have `options[:inverse_of] = nil`. This means, by default we do not use automatic inverse finding.\r\n\r\nConversely, having the user specify `options[:inverse_of] = true` to use automatic associations doesn't make sense because at that point, the user can make the extra couple characters and type in the inverse.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2013-06-08T05:07:25Z","updated_at":"2013-06-09T20:06:53Z","closed_at":"2013-06-09T08:58:43Z","merged_at":"2013-06-09T08:58:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"5124125b01bc27d2f7aeb05fe489d9066078229e","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10886/commits","review_comments_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10886/comments","review_comment_url":"/repos/rails/rails/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/10886/comments","head":{"label":"wangjohn:chnges_for_automatic_inverse_associations","ref":"chnges_for_automatic_inverse_associations","sha":"d6b03a376787ec9c9e934e5688a38c576f2e39b7","user":{"login":"wangjohn","id":1075780,"avatar_url":"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0f072cda8c91e247b8dd76fa1b10a64e.png","gravatar_id":"ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn","html_url":"https://github.com/wangjohn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/received_events","type":"User"},"repo":{"id":7698202,"name":"rails","full_name":"wangjohn/rails","owner":{"login":"wangjohn","id":1075780,"avatar_url":"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0f072cda8c91e247b8dd76fa1b10a64e.png","gravatar_id":"ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn","html_url":"https://github.com/wangjohn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/received_events","type":"User"},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/wangjohn/rails","description":"Ruby

This caused it to use the wrong regex match data to populate the template dependency. Because underscore is a valid character for a variable, this fixes the ERBTracker to match it

found my self in a situation today where I wanted to rescue from a delegate exception where the object I was delegating to was nil. Right now this throws a standard `RuntimeError` with a detailed message, which is great, but in this case I didn't want to rescue from other exceptions. I think adding this simple `DelegationError` class would make working with these exceptions a bit cleaner.\r\n\r\nI hope others find this valuable.

```kine``` is old, nobody uses it anymore.\r\n\r\nToday, I was debugging a mongoid [issue](https://github.com/mongoid/mongoid/issues/3079), and on the issue guy is using a class named Cow. I ran the same example local and couldn't find the collection that the cow was going to, I, of course, was looking for a collection named 'cows' and couldnt find it. After a few minutes of debugging I realize that for activesupport/inflections the plural of cow is kine. Me as a non native english speaker started asking around the office to see if someone would guess the right plural of cow, guess what, nobody said 'kine'. After a [few](http://thebettereditor.wordpress.com/2012/02/10/the-plural-of-cow-is/) [research](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kine), I saw that kine it is indeed a archaic word. So IMO activesupport should remove that irregular
