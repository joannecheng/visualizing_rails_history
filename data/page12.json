allows you to skip callbacks that are defined by objects, e.g. for\r\n`ActionController`:\r\n\r\n    skip_after_filter MySpecialFilter\r\n\r\nPreviously this didn't work due to a bug in how Rails compared callbacks\r\nin `Callback#matches?`. When a callback is compiled, if it's an object\r\nfilter (i.e. not a method, proc, etc.), `Callback` now defines a method on\r\n`@klass` that is derived from the class name rather than `@callback_id`.\r\nSo, when `skip_callback` tries to find the appropriate callback to\r\nremove, `Callback` can regenerate the method name for the filter\r\nobject and return the correct value for `Callback#matches?`.","created_at":"2013-04-04T23:11:55Z","updated_at":"2013-07-05T13:21:06Z","closed_at":"2013-04-22T04:19:18Z","merged_at":"2013-04-22T04:19:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"05b78f2a73e30ced9e0415783aa7d5add98bd601","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10096/commits","review_comments_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10096/comments","review_comment_url":"/repos/rails/rails/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/10096/comments","head":{"label":"benmcredmond:fix_skipping_object_callback_filters","ref":"fix_skipping_object_callback_filters","sha":"8e1d3cd4909c83bbceb7df00da71ec1393a90f6e","user":{"login":"benmcredmond","id":83981,"avatar_url":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/873dc46aca0261e0a60ebf75f6e10f26?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F62b7ada1994288382a66b6ef184f864b.png","gravatar_id":"873dc46aca0261e0a60ebf75f6e10f26","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmcredmond","html_url":"https://github.com/benmcredmond","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmcredmond/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmcredmond/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmcredmond/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmcredmond/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmcredmond/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmcredmond/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmcredmond/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmcredmond/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmcredmond/received_events","type":"User"},"repo":{"id":7406141,"name":"rails","full_name":"benmcredmond/rails","owner":{"login":"benmcredmond","id":83981,"avatar_url":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/873dc46aca0261e0a60ebf75f6e10f26?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F62b7ada1994288382a66b6ef184f864b.png","gravatar_id":"873dc46aca0261e0a60ebf75f6e10f26","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmcredmond","html_url":"https://github.com/benmcredmond","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmcredmond/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmcredmond/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmcredmond/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmcredmond/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmcredmond/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmcredmond/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmcredmond/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmcredmond/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmcredmond/received_events","type":"User"},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/benmcredmond/rails","description":"Ruby

have a deprecation warning in place if you set only `secret_token`, so that should alleviate any concerns we have about security here. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/railties/lib/rails/application.rb#L138-L147\r\n\r\nPeople will be nagged into setting `secret_key_base`. Leaving `secret_token` set causes no harm, and its presence allows for a smooth transition from Rails 3.x to 4.x. \r\n\r\nI propose that we leave `LegacyKeyGenerator` around beyond version 4.0.x. \r\n\r\nI suspect that latecomers will attempt to upgrade from 3.x to whatever the most recent 4.x version happens to be. If we remove `LegacyKeyGenerator`, then people attempting to upgrade from 3.x to >= 4.1 won't be able to preserve their existing signed cookies and cookie-based sessions.

to @tenderlove's ed9e3f699ab3fac01ad9ef038847d1cdd4c9f063, this pull request swaps out `class_eval` of strings for dynamic methods, and replaces it using either `define_method` or `delegate`.\r\n\r\nI originally wrote this in January, for use in RubyMotion which doesn't support string eval. I didn't create a PR because at the time it seemed the preference was to use string eval when generating dynamic methods. If this is no longer the case, then perhaps there is interest in these changes.\r\n\r\nThis PR leaves `callbacks.rb` and `core_ext/module/delegation.rb` untouched. Rewriting their use of string eval would cause the code to be quite a bit less readable.\r\n\r\nI ran the tests using ruby

json/encoding respects the JSON spec (as it should) which disallows \\n and \\r inside strings, escaping them as expected.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, ECMA-262 (Javascript) disallows not only \\n and \\r in strings, but \"Line Terminators\" which includes U+2028 and U+2029. See here: http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-7.3\r\n\r\nThis pull request adds U+2028 and U+2029 to be escaped.\r\n\r\n# Why? \r\n\r\nIt's very common to see something like this in a Rails template:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\nvar posts = <%= @posts.to_json %>;\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf U+2028 or U+2029 are part of any attributes output in the to_json call, you will end up with an exception. In Chrome: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL.\r\n\r\nIn other words, if one of your users pastes something into a textarea that happens to include these fancy unicode line terminators, and you run to_json on that model and stick it in a template, that page is probably broken now.\r\n\r\n# Why not?\r\n\r\nThis is JSON encoding, and the JSON spec is specific about how to encode strings. U+2028 and U+2029 don't get special treatment.\r\n\r\nThat being said, this is non-obvious, counterintuitive, and can be tough to debug (https://www.google.com/?q=u2028). \r\n\r\nWhat do you do in your apps to deal with this?

often the case that when you have an association and you only want to append an ActiveRecord object to the association if that association does not already hold your object. For example, consider the case where you have the following setup:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Blackboard\r\n  belongs_to :classroom\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Classroom\r\n  has_many :blackboards\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow let's say you just obtained a blackboard object from the params hash. If you want to make sure that the blackboard object is in the ``@classroom.blackboards`` association only once, you have to do a manual check to make sure you don't add it a second time.\r\n\r\n```ruby \r\nblackboard = Blackboard.find(params[:id])\r\nblackboard.modify_in_some_way!\r\n\r\nunless @classroom.blackboards.include?(blackboard)\r\n   @classroom.blackboards <<

now, the HTML sanitizer is incredibly hard to read. This PR is a small step towards making it better. \r\n\r\nA lot of the code that was used in the ``Selector`` class was repeated. I've refactored some of this code into new protected helper methods. The ``concatenate_subset_to_matches!`` method refactors code that was basically copy and pasted in 3 different locations. \r\n\r\nI've also changed some ``for`` loops into ``each`` blocks, since in ``for`` loops, the iterator variable persists after the loop has been completed. There's no reason to do this in the ``match`` method (since those variables aren't used later).","created_at":"2013-04-01T22:55:29Z","updated_at":"2013-04-01T23:12:21Z","closed_at":"2013-04-01T23:03:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"76618d88ac1ab70b07694755000e6356527a3421","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10037/commits","review_comments_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10037/comments","review_comment_url":"/repos/rails/rails/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/10037/comments","head":{"label":"wangjohn:selector_refactoring","ref":"selector_refactoring","sha":"a6aacccdeddb18d995706963c741476e518ec1cb","user":{"login":"wangjohn","id":1075780,"avatar_url":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0f072cda8c91e247b8dd76fa1b10a64e.png","gravatar_id":"ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn","html_url":"https://github.com/wangjohn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/received_events","type":"User"},"repo":{"id":7698202,"name":"rails","full_name":"wangjohn/rails","owner":{"login":"wangjohn","id":1075780,"avatar_url":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0f072cda8c91e247b8dd76fa1b10a64e.png","gravatar_id":"ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn","html_url":"https://github.com/wangjohn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/received_events","type":"User"},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/wangjohn/rails","description":"Ruby

issue https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/10019 cropped up after I made the following change: https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/840ca09.  The change makes it so that if the ``:inverse_of`` option is specified on an association, then ActiveRecord will first check the in-memory association cache for the record before going to the database when ``find()`` is called. However, this not longer throws a ``RecordNotFound`` exception.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I'm changing the behavior so that ``RecordNotFound`` is thrown in the correct circumstances. I've also refactored the code in the ``FindersMethod`` module so that it can be reused in the new check I've made.","created_at":"2013-04-01T01:31:24Z","updated_at":"2013-04-01T20:01:25Z","closed_at":"2013-04-01T20:00:50Z","merged_at":"2013-04-01T20:00:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"05781d312ac0b032387803f56b2bd701b0753dd1","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10022/commits","review_comments_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10022/comments","review_comment_url":"/repos/rails/rails/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/10022/comments","head":{"label":"wangjohn:find_on_nonexistent_id_raises_error","ref":"find_on_nonexistent_id_raises_error","sha":"6c5032f53de9f4ba1669ff9c9eea25c70bf3af33","user":{"login":"wangjohn","id":1075780,"avatar_url":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0f072cda8c91e247b8dd76fa1b10a64e.png","gravatar_id":"ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn","html_url":"https://github.com/wangjohn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/received_events","type":"User"},"repo":{"id":7698202,"name":"rails","full_name":"wangjohn/rails","owner":{"login":"wangjohn","id":1075780,"avatar_url":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0f072cda8c91e247b8dd76fa1b10a64e.png","gravatar_id":"ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn","html_url":"https://github.com/wangjohn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/received_events","type":"User"},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/wangjohn/rails","description":"Ruby

definition for `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SchemaStatements::TableDefinition#add_index` looks like\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nadd_index(table_name, column_name, options = {})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can lead plugin writers to assume that `options` will always be a Hash, which has worked well so far.\r\n\r\nThis change makes the assumption hold when `TableDefinition#references` receives an `index` option set to `true`. I think the few extra hashes created during migrations are well worth not breaking 3rd-party code that relies on the Hash assumption, and I hope that you will agree with me.\r\n\r\nExample of broken plugin: https://github.com/dazuma/activerecord-postgis-adapter/pull/60\r\n\r\nI hope the test I added is alright, and I'll be happy to change it based on

found following issue.\r\n\r\nWhen creating new association object with a block:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n    parent.association.build do |child|\r\n      child.parent.equal?(parent) # false\r\n    end\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe block the `child.parent` did not point to the same object.\r\nBut when the object is created it points to same instance:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n    child = parent.association.build\r\n    child.parent.equal?(parent) # true\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo this patch fixes it by setting inverse_of record right after object is build for the association.\r\n\r\nIf the patch is right I'll add CHANGELOG entry and backport it to `3-2-stable`

Automatically configure cookie-based sessions to be encrypted if `secret_key_base` is set, signed if only `secret_token` is set.\r\n\r\n- This eliminates the need to introduce the new `EncryptedCookieStore` and `UpgradeSignatureToEncryptionCookieStore` cookie-based session stores, so we leave only the existing `config.session_store :cookie_store` option and remove the two new options introduced in 4.0.0.beta1: `encrypted_cookie_store` and `upgrade_signature_to_encryption_cookie_store`.\r\n\r\n- Automatically upgrade existing signed cookie-based sessions from Rails 3.x to be encrypted if both `secret_key_base` and `secret_token` are set. Simply upgrade to the new key generator if only `secret_token` is set. (Pull request #9909 took care of transparently upgrading signed cookies to use the new key generator.)\r\n\r\nReasoning:\r\n\r\nThe signed cookie jar has changed to use the new Rails-internal key generator, so you are discouraged from having a known/shared secret for signing cookies / sharing sessions.\r\n\r\nIf signed cookies and signed session cookies are considered internal to Rails, then we can upgrade from signed to encrypted automatically if they opt-in by setting `secret_key_base`.\r\n\r\nIf that all makes sense, then we can just have the one session store for Rails: `cookie_store`. This reduces the number of config options and allows us to state the caveats around upgrading plainly in one place.\r\n\r\n/cc @jeremy @spastorino @neerajdotname\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\n@fxn (or someone else interested in documentation) I'm wondering if we should include a link to the upgrade guide, which is where the caveats/warnings/etc about setting `secret_key_base` are currently. \r\n\r\nShould we use: http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/upgrading_ruby_on_rails.html or something? Should we just leave this as-is?\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nFurther possible work:\r\n\r\nI'd like to continue with a bit more work here, if these ideas make sense:\r\n\r\n1. Standardize on `name` instead of `key` when referring to cookies. We use both now and @jeremy prefers `name` which is fine by me. Also standardize `private` spacing as per JK's comments. \r\n\r\n2. I think we also need to fix `PermanentCookieJar`'s `[]` method, which may have been broken in 2b773e148b. It's confusing `key` and `name`. I'm not sure why there's no failing test.\r\n\r\n3. Rename `DummyKeyGenerator` to `LegacyKeyGenerator` -- \"dummy\" isn't a very descriptive name. I've settled on \"legacy\" to refer to signed stuff generated by Rails 3.x. I'm open to other names, but I'd like to move away from \"dummy\". \r\n\r\n4. Don't remove `Dummy/LegacyKeyGenerator` in 4.1. I think we should keep this around a bit longer to ensure that people can upgrade from 3.2.x to 4.1.x etc. There's \"fixme\" comments in place that I'd like to remove. \r\n\r\n5. Use `Dummy/LegacyKeyGenerator` where it makes sense instead of `MessageVerifier` directly. Anything referring to signed cookies should use `Dummy/LegacyKeyGenerator`, I believe.

Updating a record within an after_create hook no longer works on ActiveRecord 4.x\r\n\r\nIn prior versions of ActiveRecord (2.x and 3.x), you used to be able to define an `after_create` hook which could make additional `save` calls on the record.  For example:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Topic < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  after_create do\r\n    update_attribute(\"author_name\", \"David\")\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\ntopic = Topic.new\r\ntopic.title = \"Another New Topic\"\r\ntopic.save\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was caused by #9707 which just recently was merged.\r\n\r\n@route /
