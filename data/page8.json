An exception will be raised if the current version of migrations stored in the database is not greater than or equal to the last version from the db/migrate folder. This check requires a database connection which may not exist. \r\n\r\nThe problem comes when someone creates a new application using a non sqlite database\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rails new -d postgresql\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf someone runs this then visits the server they will get an error because they likely have not created the database yet though our migration check is attempting to get the schema version from the database. This PR fixes that problem.\r\n\r\nIf there are no migrations in db/migration then there cannot be migrations pending, so a database connection is not needed. This PR checks to see if there are 0 migrations, and if so `needs_migration?` will return false instead of hitting the database to detect the current_version.\r\n\r\nATP Active

this commit, #reject returned a HashWithIndifferentAccess, whereas #select returned a Hash. Now #select also returns a HashWithIndifferentAccess.\r\n\r\nI think the behavior was confusing, refactoring some code I changed a couple of `hash_with_indifferent_access.reject { |k,v| v.blank? }` by a `hash_with_indifferent_access.select { |k,v| v.present? }` because I found it a lot more readable in the context it was, and was surprised that the behavior changed.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if testing

create a new app with `rails new my_app -O`\r\n- create a Ruby class that includes `ActiveModel::Model` in `app/models`\r\n- load up a Rails console and try to do anything with the class

#5554\r\n\r\nPreviously the code path for `#count` used some [validation logic](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/54122067acaad39b277a5363c6d11d6804c7bf6b/activerecord/lib/active_record/relation/calculations.rb#L389-L394) and used to fall back on `#count(:all)`. This prevented the execution of some specific count queries.\r\n\r\nThis patch gets rid of the validation logic and let's the database decide if the query is valid or not. One backwards incompatible result of this patch is the following:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nrelation = User.select(\"id, name\")\r\n\r\n# later in the code\r\nrelation.count\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis count will now blow up because it you can't count on two columns. The solution is to specify the counting column explicitly:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nrelation.count(:all)\r\n```","created_at":"2013-05-21T12:40:33Z","updated_at":"2013-08-16T15:18:22Z","closed_at":"2013-06-09T13:02:57Z","merged_at":"2013-06-09T13:02:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"b982cd52695ef582ca91aad14fc15276e708d39e","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10710/commits","review_comments_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10710/comments","review_comment_url":"/repos/rails/rails/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/10710/comments","head":{"label":"senny:5554_let_the_database_raise_on_counts","ref":"5554_let_the_database_raise_on_counts","sha":"da9b5d4a8435b744fcf278fffd6d7f1e36d4a4f2","user":{"login":"senny","id":5402,"avatar_url":"https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/3d698e2872c07061a455d9e250861235?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fd1359f9934ee5a75ed441ffce412a0a1.png","gravatar_id":"3d698e2872c07061a455d9e250861235","url":"https://api.github.com/users/senny","html_url":"https://github.com/senny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senny/received_events","type":"User"},"repo":{"id":1776780,"name":"rails","full_name":"senny/rails","owner":{"login":"senny","id":5402,"avatar_url":"https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/3d698e2872c07061a455d9e250861235?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fd1359f9934ee5a75ed441ffce412a0a1.png","gravatar_id":"3d698e2872c07061a455d9e250861235","url":"https://api.github.com/users/senny","html_url":"https://github.com/senny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senny/received_events","type":"User"},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/senny/rails","description":"Ruby

touch test db when `Rails.env == development`.\r\n\r\nCurrently, `rake db:create`, `rake db:drop`, and derived tasks (such as `rake db:reset`) create and drop both the development and test databases when `'development' == Rails.env`. Such behaviour vioates the Principle of Least Surprise. It's extremely confusing to execute this:\r\n\r\n    $ bundle exec rake db:reset\r\n\r\nor this:\r\n\r\n    $ RAILS_ENV=development bundle exec rake db:reset\r\n\r\n...and discover that your test database is being recreated. This behaviour can be functionally problematic. For example, assume a Rails project had the following in their `database.yml` config:\r\n\r\n    development:\r\n      adapter: sqlite3\r\n      database: db/development.sqlite3\r\n      pool: 5\r\n      timeout: 5000\r\n\r\n    test:\r\n      adapter: postgresql\r\n      encoding: unicode\r\n      database: myapp_test\r\n      pool: 5\r\n      username: username\r\n      password: hackme\r\n\r\nIf a developer does not have postgresql installed and configured, Rake tasks which attempt to recreate the development database will fail because of the test database. That's silly.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes this behaviour. I've tested the changes with sqlite, mysql, and postgresql. sqlite and mysql pass with flying colors.\r\n\r\npostgresql failed unit testing, but I think it failed because of unrelated reasons. If someone else could verify, that would be great.
