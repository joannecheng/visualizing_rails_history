call `save`, a database level unique index error will be thrown. \r\n\r\nThis happens because the record destruction happens after record creation.\r\n\r\nIn this pull request, I moved the record destruction ahead of the record creation.\r\n\r\nThis is my first pull request ever, so please go easy on me.  :smile: \r\n\r\nThe existing tests still pass.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to write a test that

use of pluralization and depends on this function returning consistent results.  You can see the results http://intertwingly.net/projects/AWDwR4/checkdepot/section-15.2.html where we get a `Could not find table 'cart'` error message when we switch locales.\r\n\r\nPreferred solutions are to either revert the original commit, or to give ActiveRecord a separate locale.

In this relation all the context that\r\n`Post` was joined with `Author` is lost and hence the error that `author` was not found on `Comment`.\r\n\r\nThs solution is to build JoinAssociation when two relations with join information are being merged.

statement cache allows users to cache a single statement, which can then be executed for more optimized performance.

otp_secret_key:string\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass User < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  has_one_time_password\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe otp_secret_key is saved automatically when a object is created\r\n\r\n### Authenticating using a code\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nuser.authenticate_otp('186522') # => true\r\nsleep 30\r\nuser.authenticate_otp('186522') # => false\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Authenticating using a slightly old
