pull request concerns Issue https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/776. \r\n\r\nI handle memory bloat by having the transaction hold only the AR objects which it absolutely needs to know about. These are the AR objects with callbacks (they need to be updated as soon as something in the transaction occurs). \r\n\r\nAll other AR objects can be updated lazily by keeping a reference to a TransactionState object. If an AR object is inside a transaction, then the transaction will add its TransactionState to the AR object. When the user makes a call to some attribute on an AR object (which has no callbacks) associated with a transaction, the AR object will call the sync_with_transaction_state method and make sure it is up to date with the transaction. After it has synced with the transaction state, the AR object will return the attribute that was requested.\r\n\r\nMost of the logic in the changes are used to handle multiple transactions, in which case the AR object has to recursively follow parent pointers of TransactionState objects.

to issue 776: https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/776. \r\n\r\nI created a universally unique identifier (uuid) for all activerecord objects which are associated with transactions. Each transaction contains a set of uuids of AR objects. This means that there are no direct references to the AR objects themselves so they can get garbage collected. On callbacks and rollbacks, I used the ObjectSpace to find all live AR objects and see if their uuid is contained within the transaction.\r\n\r\nNote that this fix doesn't work in JRuby because ObjectSpace doesn't exist there. Later I'll be creating a TransactionRecord object which holds a uuid and an AR object, so that ObjectSpace can filter by only transaction records and iterate over a much smaller set to improve performance.\r\n\r\nAlso added some tests for transaction memory bloat and removed the now unneeded TransactionState object and its associated tests.","created_at":"2013-01-23T16:56:59Z","updated_at":"2013-01-24T16:14:34Z","closed_at":"2013-01-24T16:06:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9ad2e4e1fc09d0d0ad7295c4a767822fd01d2497","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9044/commits","review_comments_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9044/comments","review_comment_url":"/repos/rails/rails/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/9044/comments","head":{"label":"wangjohn:transaction_object_space","ref":"transaction_object_space","sha":"1ea99373507fdc5498a4cba29be1686345b2990e","user":{"login":"wangjohn","id":1075780,"avatar_url":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0f072cda8c91e247b8dd76fa1b10a64e.png","gravatar_id":"ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn","html_url":"https://github.com/wangjohn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/received_events","type":"User"},"repo":{"id":7698202,"name":"rails","full_name":"wangjohn/rails","owner":{"login":"wangjohn","id":1075780,"avatar_url":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0f072cda8c91e247b8dd76fa1b10a64e.png","gravatar_id":"ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn","html_url":"https://github.com/wangjohn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/received_events","type":"User"},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/wangjohn/rails","description":"Ruby

testing a Rails 4 app in semi-production, I noticed that CSRF protection threw exceptions on HEAD requests by crawler bots.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Shall I make a pull request that adds support for a HEAD request in the csrf protection code? Should we find a way to convert HEAD -> GET just like in Rails <4.\r\n\r\nAfter discovering, I read in the CHANGELOG that `ActionDispatch::Head` was replaced in favor of `Rack::Head` by  Santiago Pastorino. `ActionDispatch::Head` converted a HEAD to a GET request like so:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n    def call(env)\r\n      if env[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"HEAD\"\r\n        env[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] = \"GET\"\r\n        env[\"rack.methodoverride.original_method\"] = \"HEAD\"\r\n        status, headers, _ = @app.call(env)\r\n        [status, headers, []]\r\n      else\r\n        @app.call(env)\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever. `Rack::Head` middleware does not do this HEAD -> GET conversion in https://github.com/rack/rack/blob/master/lib/rack/head.rb.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n    if env[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"HEAD\"\r\n      body.close if body.respond_to? :close\r\n      [status, headers, []]\r\n    else\r\n      [status, headers, body]\r\n    end\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe could easily add a `request.head?` in `valid_request?` to support this. But somehow I feel there are more reasons and code that depends on HEAD requests being converted to GETs.\r\n\r\nAdded a failing test for now.","created_at":"2013-01-22T20:39:45Z","updated_at":"2013-01-28T15:33:28Z","closed_at":"2013-01-28T15:25:21Z","merged_at":"2013-01-28T15:25:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"e4def78d13ddf7a519540580ea3e1a0e675b64dd","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9032/commits","review_comments_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9032/comments","review_comment_url":"/repos/rails/rails/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/9032/comments","head":{"label":"firmhouse:head-breaks-csrf","ref":"head-breaks-csrf","sha":"2ef138f0d49e92550bb74a103df7ce5074b18241","user":{"login":"firmhouse","id":647196,"avatar_url":"https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4544279c76bb6a7446bf9bd554ef3f77?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0f1f410d6c0885ea2e52fb7caf92279a.png","gravatar_id":"4544279c76bb6a7446bf9bd554ef3f77","url":"https://api.github.com/users/firmhouse","html_url":"https://github.com/firmhouse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/firmhouse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/firmhouse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/firmhouse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/firmhouse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/firmhouse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/firmhouse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/firmhouse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/firmhouse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/firmhouse/received_events","type":"Organization"},"repo":{"id":7760275,"name":"rails","full_name":"firmhouse/rails","owner":{"login":"firmhouse","id":647196,"avatar_url":"https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4544279c76bb6a7446bf9bd554ef3f77?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0f1f410d6c0885ea2e52fb7caf92279a.png","gravatar_id":"4544279c76bb6a7446bf9bd554ef3f77","url":"https://api.github.com/users/firmhouse","html_url":"https://github.com/firmhouse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/firmhouse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/firmhouse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/firmhouse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/firmhouse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/firmhouse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/firmhouse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/firmhouse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/firmhouse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/firmhouse/received_events","type":"Organization"},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/firmhouse/rails","description":"Ruby

the `Time.zone` in an `after_initialize` block can become a problem for people upgrading, since it's not going to be available when `config/initializers` run, and people might be relying on it.\r\n    \r\nAn example that I noticed was with the [Chronic gem](https://github.com/mojombo/chronic), for date/time parsing. It requires us [to configure the time class to be Time.zone](https://github.com/mojombo/chronic#time-zones), and doing that in an initializer no longer worked with these changes.\r\n\r\nExample code in `config/initializers/chronic.rb`:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nChronic.time_class = Time.zone\r\n```\r\n\r\nI had to change to this to make it work with the locale change:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nRails.configuration.after_initialize do\r\n  Chronic.time_class = Time.zone\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven though I think it'd be good to move the locale options, I don't think this change should affect people relying on the current behavior, so it seems safer to revert now.\r\n\r\n*I'm sending as a pull request to get some feedback from @steveklabnik and @rafaelfranca, to check if I'm not forgetting to revert anything else*.","created_at":"2013-01-22T11:44:09Z","updated_at":"2013-01-22T13:49:36Z","closed_at":"2013-01-22T13:44:29Z","merged_at":"2013-01-22T13:44:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"e3fa3e9dc719ba5da3423543e1fd74dbfa272123","assignee":null,"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/milestones/9","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/milestones/9/labels","id":44893,"number":9,"title":"4.0.0","description":"Changes

debugging routes it can sometimes be difficult to understand exactly how the paths are matched. This PR adds a JS based path matching widget to the `/rails/info/routes` output. You can enter in a path, and it will tell you which of the routes that path matches, while preserving order (top match wins).\r\n\r\nThe matching widget in action:\r\n\r\n![](http://f.cl.ly/items/3A2F0v2m3m1Z1p3P3O3k/path-match.gif)\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR the only way to check matching paths is via mental math, or typing in a path in the url bar and seeing where it goes. This feature will be an invaluable debugging tool by dramatically decreasing the time needed to check a path match. \r\n\r\n\r\nTo newcomers: you can run this route page in Rails 3.2 (without this feature), using [Sextant](https://github.com/schneems/sextant). \r\n\r\nIt has also been noted that this PR is: **[OVER 9000](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiMHTK15Pik)**. \r\n\r\nATP

2.3.15 increased the required rack version to 1.1.3, this brought\r\nin [some changes to the way multiple cookies are handled](https://github.com/rack/rack/commit/7754cdb5f5fa937ed3e1a811680f349d0acba73d) in a response.\r\nPreviously they were stored as an Array but now they are stored as a\r\nString.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this there is a failing test, test_multiple_cookies(CookieTest)\r\n[actionpack/test/controller/cookie_test.rb:125]. This change fixes the\r\ntest and also resolves the original issue I encountered.\r\n\r\nThe original issue was failing integration tests (under ruby 1.8) due to\r\na stray new line being added to the cookie string. This in turn resulted\r\nin an empty string being included in the cookies array when it was split\r\nin [ActionController::Integration::Session](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/2-3-stable/actionpack/lib/action_controller/integration.rb#L328).\r\n\r\nFor example a the cookie string would go from:\r\n\r\n    cookie1=aaa\\ncookie2=bbb\r\n\r\nto:\r\n\r\n    cookie1=aaa\\n\\ncookie2=bbb\r\n\r\nresulting in `cookies` being set to `[\"cookie1=aaa\", \"\", \"cookie2=bbb\"]`\r\nin Integration::Session, which would subsequently cause an exception to\r\nbe raised when the empty [string was split on line 330](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/2-3-stable/actionpack/lib/action_controller/integration.rb#L330).\r\n\r\nThe stray new line is introduced by convert_cookies! in\r\nActionController::Response. The use of Kernel#Array in ruby 1.8 was\r\nsplitting the string on new lines but does not consume the new line, so\r\nwhen the array is eventually joined back into a string extra new lines\r\nare present.\r\n\r\nIn ruby 1.9 Kernel#Array no longer splits, thus the test failed because\r\nit was expecting multiple cookies but only getting one.","created_at":"2013-01-16T22:27:44Z","updated_at":"2013-01-17T17:23:16Z","closed_at":"2013-01-17T00:05:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dd97ad865a445ad6de16343e4eb2a49143887d71","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8969/commits","review_comments_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8969/comments","review_comment_url":"/repos/rails/rails/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/8969/comments","head":{"label":"wezm:fix-multiple-cookie-handling","ref":"fix-multiple-cookie-handling","sha":"eb6514bd69161cf72f18a0368b5f88b3488cad37","user":{"login":"wezm","id":21787,"avatar_url":"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/a572775f003705896160fa44c4d26291?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F70431822025c237eddc9145838fc7046.png","gravatar_id":"a572775f003705896160fa44c4d26291","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wezm","html_url":"https://github.com/wezm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wezm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wezm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wezm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wezm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wezm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wezm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wezm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wezm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wezm/received_events","type":"User"},"repo":{"id":7616172,"name":"rails","full_name":"wezm/rails","owner":{"login":"wezm","id":21787,"avatar_url":"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/a572775f003705896160fa44c4d26291?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F70431822025c237eddc9145838fc7046.png","gravatar_id":"a572775f003705896160fa44c4d26291","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wezm","html_url":"https://github.com/wezm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wezm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wezm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wezm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wezm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wezm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wezm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wezm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wezm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wezm/received_events","type":"User"},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/wezm/rails","description":"Ruby

a new client accesses an app, `session[:session_id]` will return `nil`,\r\nsince no session cookie was sent and no session is created until an attempt\r\nis made to _write_ to the session hash. This patch simply forces a session\r\nto be created if `session[:session_id]` is requested and no session exists.\r\n\r\nA google search will show there are many who wish to access this - perhaps\r\nfor logging, or associating other records (although, I agree it's better to\r\nsimply store an associated record id _in_ the session). The most prevalent\r\nanswer seems to be to use `request.session_options[:id]`. However, I believe\r\n`session[:session_id]` is now the preferred method of obtaining this.\r\nNote that with this patch, the former will still return `nil` if no session exists.\r\n\r\nHowever, when `session[:session_id]` is requested, I believe most developers\r\nwould not expect this to return `nil`. If they wish to know whether or not\r\na session already exists, they should use `session.exists?`. Otherwise, I\r\nbelieve they expect to get the session id for the current session - whether\r\nor not the session is new or not.\r\n\r\nNote that using `protect_from_forgery` will cause the authenticity token to\r\nbe written to the session (and therefore create a session if none exists),\r\nhowever this is not done until templates are rendered.

But no backtrace is displayed in the browser or the logs.\r\n* In production, the same error messages is rendered to the response body. This exposes the user to confusing developer-speak. Also, exception notifiers won't notify the developer of the issue since the exception is eaten by `rescue_from`.\r\n\r\nAfter this pull-request, the following will occur:\r\n\r\n* In development, the Rails exception page will be rendered, complete with backtrace and code snippet showing offending line.\r\n* In production, the appropriate error page is rendered.\r\n\r\nI didn't change the response code; it's still `400`. Since a default Rails app doesn't include a `400.html` file, an empty response body will be rendered by default in production.\r\n\r\nPossibly we could change the response code to `422`? It seems like an appropriate code and Rails generates a `422.html` by default.\r\n\r\nThanks!","created_at":"2013-01-16T01:07:09Z","updated_at":"2013-01-16T01:30:06Z","closed_at":"2013-01-16T01:28:30Z","merged_at":"2013-01-16T01:28:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"3f573801abf676d0056acde6430a9c363fcc5fd8","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8958/commits","review_comments_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8958/comments","review_comment_url":"/repos/rails/rails/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/8958/comments","head":{"label":"balexand:strong_parameters_exception_handling","ref":"strong_parameters_exception_handling","sha":"8e221127abf5262183c20e981f7cf1ff4bfe1a4f","user":{"login":"balexand","id":181187,"avatar_url":"https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/6180d7335815945eda8651e080be4b98?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F719e4a634d354ee009ee1b9b148b8eef.png","gravatar_id":"6180d7335815945eda8651e080be4b98","url":"https://api.github.com/users/balexand","html_url":"https://github.com/balexand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balexand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balexand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balexand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balexand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balexand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balexand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balexand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balexand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balexand/received_events","type":"User"},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"rails:master","ref":"master","sha":"8492396e9c1fe21036783d9785ed42c27dee9201","user":{"login":"rails","id":4223,"avatar_url":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/30f39a09e233e8369dddf6feb4be0308?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Ff42a37d114a480b6b57b60ea9a14a9d2.png","gravatar_id":"30f39a09e233e8369dddf6feb4be0308","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails","html_url":"https://github.com/rails","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/received_events","type":"Organization"},"repo":{"id":8514,"name":"rails","full_name":"rails/rails","owner":{"login":"rails","id":4223,"avatar_url":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/30f39a09e233e8369dddf6feb4be0308?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Ff42a37d114a480b6b57b60ea9a14a9d2.png","gravatar_id":"30f39a09e233e8369dddf6feb4be0308","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails","html_url":"https://github.com/rails","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/received_events","type":"Organization"},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails","description":"Ruby

There's no updated gem (for 2.3)\r\n* The commit doesn't exist on GitHub\r\n* There's no tag\r\n* The vulnerability is not addressed on the blog\r\n* There's no test\r\n* The code fix looks... strange\r\n* The email is not signed\r\n\r\nIf this problem is legitimate, and the patch fixes it, we would immensely appreciate an updated Rails 2 gem.

is an inconsistency between the conditional logic in\r\nthe definition of ActiveSupport::TestCase and the conditional logic in\r\nActiveSupport::Testing::SetupAndTeardown [1].\r\n\r\nIn some circumstances, it's possible for MiniTest to be defined, but\r\nfor ActiveSupport::TestCase *not* to have MiniTest::Unit::TestCase or\r\nMiniTest::Assertions in its ancestor chain. e.g. in Ruby 1.8 with the\r\nminitest gem included in the bundle. In this case, the\r\nTest::Unit/MiniTest shim/wrapper is not present and so\r\nTest::Unit::TestCase (and therefore ActiveSupport::TestCase) is\r\ncompletely independent of MiniTest::Unit::TestCase.\r\n\r\nThe conditional logic in the definition of ActiveSupport::TestCase does\r\nnot take this scenario into account, whereas the logic in\r\nActiveSupport::Testing::SetupAndTeardown does take it into account.\r\n\r\nThe changes in this commit are an alternative to the change in [2] which\r\nwas reverted in [3].\r\n\r\nSimilar

the Rails server ran for long enough, Chome started returning a `net::ERR_RESPONSE_HEADERS_TOO_BIG` error on every page load, and curl would error with `curl: (27) Avoided giant realloc for header (max is 102400)!`. A server restart would reset the headers and made the problem temporarily go away.\r\n\r\nInvestigating showed that the same `IE=Edge,` headers were being appended on every request until finally the header size exceeded the 100k limit that browsers impose. \r\n\r\nThis patch ensures that the IE=Edge and other header variables only get appended to the X-UA-Compatible header if they are not there already, and it makes the test pass that I modified to catch the problem.\r\n\r\nThe commit that introduced this problem (d8c1404107501e131e4c7c653794768f5c461793, @nikitug) was applied to both master
