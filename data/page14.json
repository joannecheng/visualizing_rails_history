believe the reason ``Railtie::Configurable`` was created was so that the subclasses of the Railtie class would have the methods in the Configurable module (such as ``instance``, ``configure``, and ``method_missing``). However, the implementer of Railtie did not want Railtie itself to have these methods.\r\n\r\nThis was implemented by forcing all modules that inherit from Railtie to include the Configurable module like so:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Railtie\r\n  class << self\r\n    def inherited(base)\r\n      base.send(:include, Railtie::Configurable)\r\n    end\r\n  ...\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis isn't great because it forces all the subclasses of Railtie to have this module, which isn't ideal behavior. Instead, it would be nice to use inheritance to make sure these methods appear in subclasses of Railties.\r\n\r\nI've made it so that the Railtie class has the methods from Railtie::Configurable, and that Railtie itself cannot be instantiated and is effectively an abstract

of the story: One must be careful about lazily initializing\r\ninstance variables when subclassing.\r\n\r\nI would like to draw your attention to https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/4652 where\r\nthe reader will see that there appears to be some kind of initialization issue\r\nin rails.\r\n\r\nThe source of this issue is that:\r\n1) Engine#env_config contains \"@env_config ||= ...\"\r\n2) Application#env_config contains \"@env_config ||= ...\"\r\n3) Threads are in the picture\r\n4) Thread A calls Application#env_config, which super's to Engine#env_config\r\n5) After Engine#env_config returns but before Application#env_config sets @env_config again, Thread B begins running\r\n6) Thread B calls Application#env_config\r\n7) Thread B finds @env_config to contain a value (the one set by Engine#env_config) and returns it\r\n8) Thread B blows up because key set by Application#env_config are there.\r\n9) People report bugs with puma, thin, rainbows, webrick, etc\r\n10) Evan becomes tired of seeing these bugs\r\n11) Evan pours himself a stiff drink, puts on Top Gear(tm), and begins debugging\r\n12) Evan finds the source of the bug\r\n13) Evan authors a PR\r\n14) RIGHT NOW.\r\n\r\nThe bug is fixed by simply using a different ivar name in the methods.\r\nAlternately, Engine#env_config could just return a new Hash each time, not memoizing into @env_config.\r\n\r\nI bid you

seeing #6534 I found out that there is no XML equivalent of `to_json` method in Rails core. As some of us are still using XML I thought that I could prepare proof of concept of such method and see if it is good idea.\r\n\r\nIt's current state is far from perfect(not to mention lack of tests), but my main idea is to ask if I'm going in right direction? If so I would gladly improve code base and write more tests, but right now I could use some sanity check and opinions from more experienced Rails core developers about way I'm trying to do that.\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective the biggest gain would be calling methods like `render :xml => true` - in some cases that could be useful and this is allowed in XML spec, but I'm not sure if it will not break

Since our\r\nRelation API is close to SQL terms I renamed `#uniq` to `#distinct`.\r\n\r\nThere is no deprecation. `#uniq` and `#uniq!` are aliases and will continue\r\nto work. I also updated the documentation to promote the use of `#distinct`.\r\nc7f94f0\r\n\r\n## 2.\r\n\r\nDeprecate the `:distinct` option for `Relation#count`.\r\nWe moved more and more away from passing options to finder / calculation\r\nmethods. The `:distinct` option in `#count` was one of the remaining places.\r\nSince we can now combine `Relation#distinct` with `Relation#count` the option\r\nis no longer necessary and can be

is a fix for issue #9567\r\nI think that the dependent options should be taken into account only when destroy is called on the \"parent\" of the has_many association. In the issue's example it is the post. When delete_all is called directly on the association it should ignore the dependent option completely but should call the before_add/before_remove callbacks since all existing records will be removed from the collection.\r\n\r\nThis is not the current behaviour and this change could break some existing apps. This PR might needs some additional tests but I wanted to see if you would agree on this first.","created_at":"2013-03-11T22:37:09Z","updated_at":"2013-03-12T06:16:36Z","closed_at":"2013-03-12T06:16:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"29d399a2fd8aa2dabefc671fc978449d25475dbe","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9672/commits","review_comments_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9672/comments","review_comment_url":"/repos/rails/rails/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/9672/comments","head":{"label":"stream7:master","ref":"master","sha":"9fed9f142395959a727834cb88013293ff6cef4b","user":{"login":"stream7","id":301259,"avatar_url":"https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/ad7ef5c54efa59f36d4a7a1c2d95d269?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Ff964b1aaf270d1f9e0e22e08580fbcbd.png","gravatar_id":"ad7ef5c54efa59f36d4a7a1c2d95d269","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stream7","html_url":"https://github.com/stream7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stream7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stream7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stream7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stream7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stream7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stream7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stream7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stream7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stream7/received_events","type":"User"},"repo":{"id":8714407,"name":"rails","full_name":"stream7/rails","owner":{"login":"stream7","id":301259,"avatar_url":"https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/ad7ef5c54efa59f36d4a7a1c2d95d269?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Ff964b1aaf270d1f9e0e22e08580fbcbd.png","gravatar_id":"ad7ef5c54efa59f36d4a7a1c2d95d269","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stream7","html_url":"https://github.com/stream7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stream7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stream7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stream7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stream7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stream7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stream7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stream7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stream7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stream7/received_events","type":"User"},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/stream7/rails","description":"Ruby

trying to fix this bug: https://github.com/rails/jbuilder/pull/100\r\n\r\nThe only way I see I can fix that is to redefine the ScaffoldControllerGenerator template and add hooks to it. And to do that I need to require  a lot of code including `rails/generators`.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that if I do that in jbuilder gem, it'll create `Rails::Configuration::Generators` instance and skip all custom generator settings specified in other gems.\r\n\r\nFor example, if I have `jbuilder` and `haml-rails` gems enabled, `jbuilder` requires `rails/generators` just for template/hook, and then, later `haml-rails` is doing `config.generators.template_engine :haml` which never get into `Rails::Generators.options` because it was already initialized earlier.\r\n\r\nThe other problem is that it loads a lot of generators code even if generators are not needed.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to proceed here, but one solution would be to add load hook for generator. It'll allow me to augment the generator only when it actually loads, which kinda solves both problems stated above.","created_at":"2013-03-10T12:25:09Z","updated_at":"2013-05-04T06:41:08Z","closed_at":"2013-05-04T06:41:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2a7403f0d536f850a9e586158498d74db7352bd6","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9647/commits","review_comments_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9647/comments","review_comment_url":"/repos/rails/rails/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/9647/comments","head":{"label":"rwz:master","ref":"master","sha":"8c4a9c0ad8afa9d700d9a1bb89da2b2a9dc89423","user":{"login":"rwz","id":129043,"avatar_url":"https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/df08a0889bad0229c372f702976a3da6?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F8716d223c5dd124d03b36a73660ca54e.png","gravatar_id":"df08a0889bad0229c372f702976a3da6","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwz","html_url":"https://github.com/rwz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwz/received_events","type":"User"},"repo":{"id":8684525,"name":"rails","full_name":"rwz/rails","owner":{"login":"rwz","id":129043,"avatar_url":"https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/df08a0889bad0229c372f702976a3da6?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F8716d223c5dd124d03b36a73660ca54e.png","gravatar_id":"df08a0889bad0229c372f702976a3da6","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwz","html_url":"https://github.com/rwz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwz/received_events","type":"User"},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/rwz/rails","description":"Ruby

writing.","created_at":"2013-03-10T06:50:56Z","updated_at":"2013-03-10T08:05:13Z","closed_at":"2013-03-10T08:05:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"78657039eb57712d5d98092259b1a741a327dc83","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9642/commits","review_comments_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9642/comments","review_comment_url":"/repos/rails/rails/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/9642/comments","head":{"label":"americoduarte:master","ref":"master","sha":"69a4f3595cf1069269a4b25ed67048a9f7de38a2","user":{"login":"americoduarte","id":1478616,"avatar_url":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/b4090444d21c914ff6f8dc232b55d536?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F1bdaa1a84bf0aa3e1f889279dfc19fc6.png","gravatar_id":"b4090444d21c914ff6f8dc232b55d536","url":"https://api.github.com/users/americoduarte","html_url":"https://github.com/americoduarte","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/americoduarte/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/americoduarte/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/americoduarte/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/americoduarte/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/americoduarte/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/americoduarte/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/americoduarte/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/americoduarte/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/americoduarte/received_events","type":"User"},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"rails:master","ref":"master","sha":"dff4d4ad2b7b55283132eb6cf8ac27b13827624c","user":{"login":"rails","id":4223,"avatar_url":"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/30f39a09e233e8369dddf6feb4be0308?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Ff42a37d114a480b6b57b60ea9a14a9d2.png","gravatar_id":"30f39a09e233e8369dddf6feb4be0308","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails","html_url":"https://github.com/rails","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/received_events","type":"Organization"},"repo":{"id":8514,"name":"rails","full_name":"rails/rails","owner":{"login":"rails","id":4223,"avatar_url":"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/30f39a09e233e8369dddf6feb4be0308?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Ff42a37d114a480b6b57b60ea9a14a9d2.png","gravatar_id":"30f39a09e233e8369dddf6feb4be0308","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails","html_url":"https://github.com/rails","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/received_events","type":"Organization"},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails","description":"Ruby
