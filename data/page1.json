branch has a serious performance regression when including objects for a relation. e.g. ```Item.includes(:people)```.\r\n\r\nThe regression is caused by the use of an enumerator in the relation merger.rb, see https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activerecord/lib/active_record/relation/merger.rb#L110\r\n\r\nThis causes ruby to create many fibers (6309 according to ruby-prof call graph) while iterating, when the same effect could be achieved by changing how the bind_values enumerable is accessed. See pull request.\r\n\r\nHere are my test results for my own project\r\n```\r\nRails 3.2.13\r\nItem.include(:people).limit(1000) #=> 1.049828\r\n\r\nRails 4 4-0-stable\r\nItem.include(:people).limit(1000) #=> 3.609199\r\n\r\nRails 4 master\r\nItem.include(:people).limit(1000) #=> 31.08081\r\n\r\nRails 4 master with optimization (pull request)\r\nItem.include(:people).limit(1000) #=> 2.134169\r\n```\r\nObviously there is still a performance regression between 3.2.13 and Rails 4.x, but at least this fix brings it back to a reasonable level. I'll look into the remaining performance hit soon.\r\n\r\nUse the following gist to test performance on various versions of

pull request alters the Rails.queue interface to mimic the previously implemented queue with support for namespacing. This is done using `MultiQueue`, a subclass of `Hash`. `method_missing` is then defined to pass all missing method calls to the default queue. Essentially, you can then call `Rails.queue.push` and other queue-specific methods, which is the same as calling `Rails.queue.default.push`.\r\n\r\nIf you want to namespace your queues, you can set `Rails.queue[:mailer]=...` and access it through `Rails.queue[:mailer]`.\r\n\r\n`Rails.queue=`, `Rails.application.queue=`, and `confiq.queue=` are all aliased to set the method argument as `Rails.queue.default`.\r\n\r\nIf you *really* want to override the wrapper at `Rails.queue`, you'd have to call `Rails.instance_variable_set(:@queue, arg)`. \r\n\r\nSince `MultiQueue` inherits from `Hash`, you can also define [default_proc](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/Hash.html#method-i-default_proc-3D) and implement dynamic namespacing.\r\n","created_at":"2013-08-29T02:18:29Z","updated_at":"2013-08-29T20:26:18Z","closed_at":"2013-08-29T16:45:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bcd13c5fe9cf6d53f6d2169543c53781e3d2030a","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/12064/commits","review_comments_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/12064/comments","review_comment_url":"/repos/rails/rails/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/12064/comments","head":{"label":"hstove:jobs","ref":"jobs","sha":"8d81ef67ebeb1d8797d06f96529e9fd38403c863","user":{"login":"hstove","id":1109058,"avatar_url":"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/73719c8eb97a63acd87f2f0a918a5005?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F14caf31dd5c77f161a0aff407b829e3a.png","gravatar_id":"73719c8eb97a63acd87f2f0a918a5005","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hstove","html_url":"https://github.com/hstove","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hstove/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hstove/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hstove/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hstove/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hstove/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hstove/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hstove/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hstove/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hstove/received_events","type":"User"},"repo":{"id":12100111,"name":"rails","full_name":"hstove/rails","owner":{"login":"hstove","id":1109058,"avatar_url":"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/73719c8eb97a63acd87f2f0a918a5005?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F14caf31dd5c77f161a0aff407b829e3a.png","gravatar_id":"73719c8eb97a63acd87f2f0a918a5005","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hstove","html_url":"https://github.com/hstove","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hstove/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hstove/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hstove/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hstove/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hstove/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hstove/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hstove/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hstove/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hstove/received_events","type":"User"},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/hstove/rails","description":"Ruby

Also, some other improvements to the README to reflect the current state of the framework.\r\n\r\nSummary of changes:\r\n\r\n* Reordered the paragraphs discussing MVC from View-Model-Controller to Model-Controller-View, based on how (IMHO) most people think about the structure and hierarchy of the framework and their code in it.\r\n* Added references to ActionView and its README in the _View_ paragraph.\r\n* Reworded the _Controller_ paragraph to briefly mentioned routing as handled by Action Dispatch, and that both Action Dispatch and Action Controller work together to form the request-handling Action Pack.\r\n* Changed wording in _Controller_ from \"manipulate models\" to \"load and manipulate models\", as many actions only read from models.\r\n* Removed paragraph saying Action Pack is coupled with Action View, as this is no longer the case.\r\n* Added brief references to Action Mailer and Active Support (and their respective READMEs), since they are both major Rails components. Briefly mentioned in the _View_ paragraph that Action View is often used to generate the body of the email, in addition to the other typical of using to build a response body.","created_at":"2013-08-26T20:28:47Z","updated_at":"2013-08-27T17:16:07Z","closed_at":"2013-08-27T14:04:35Z","merged_at":"2013-08-27T14:04:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"03fa0c84d402b13e4ddb7f5f893bc026ce6f2f77","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/12028/commits","review_comments_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/12028/comments","review_comment_url":"/repos/rails/rails/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/12028/comments","head":{"label":"egilburg:patch-1","ref":"patch-1","sha":"853596c92695003e92a9a7759cebfcb4b97be9ea","user":{"login":"egilburg","id":242532,"avatar_url":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/cc4f5494a8dcaaf577e678cb3901dab6?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F552d65b6e9616642fd0217dc7f8361bd.png","gravatar_id":"cc4f5494a8dcaaf577e678cb3901dab6","url":"https://api.github.com/users/egilburg","html_url":"https://github.com/egilburg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/received_events","type":"User"},"repo":{"id":11807121,"name":"rails","full_name":"egilburg/rails","owner":{"login":"egilburg","id":242532,"avatar_url":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/cc4f5494a8dcaaf577e678cb3901dab6?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F552d65b6e9616642fd0217dc7f8361bd.png","gravatar_id":"cc4f5494a8dcaaf577e678cb3901dab6","url":"https://api.github.com/users/egilburg","html_url":"https://github.com/egilburg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/received_events","type":"User"},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/egilburg/rails","description":"Ruby

output \"cache expired\", but it doesn't, and it used to in Rails 3.0. This PR brings back that functionality by making touches call `after_commit` callbacks, woo!\r\n\r\nWe relied on `after_commit` callbacks being fired by touches to do things like expire caches, send documents to our search cluster, bump versions in Redis, etc. When we upgraded to 3.2, we found this problem and had to go and add `after_touch` callbacks to all those places to get touches to cause the same changes in the system. We make pretty heavy use of touches to bump timestamps up the association chain and whatnot, so they are a principle instigator of attribute change in the system. I think having to add both callbacks to *really* get a callback fired when stuff changes is sucky because it means client code has to deal with de-duplication if both callbacks fire, client code has to be aware of the semantic differences of when they fire, and before this change there is no way to get called back to when a record's timestamp bump has definitely been committed to the database.

options will specify the prefix and the suffix. Also, I'm moving the method to be an instance method on the `Migration` instance. This makes more sense than being a class method on the `Migrator` class because the only\r\nplace that uses it is on a `Migration` instance (in a method_missing hook). The logic for the `Migrator` shouldn't be doing any work to calculate the table name, it should be the `Migration` itself.\r\n\r\nAlso made some small indentation fixes.\r\n\r\nThis will hopefully

patch replaces using condition `value.class < Base` in favor of `value.is_a?(Base)`\r\n\r\nThis is not break something in general using in Rails application (because ActiveRecord::Base is an abstract class and can not be instantiated), but makes convenient using decorator pattern.\r\n\r\nFor example [Draper gem](https://github.com/drapergem/draper) redefine [`#is_a?`](https://github.com/drapergem/draper/blob/master/lib/draper/decorator.rb#L179-L182) method to check against decorated class.\r\n\r\nSo this patch makes it possible to use\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nComment.where(commentable: post.decorate)\r\n# just like `Comment.where(commentable: post)`\r\n```\r\n\r\ninstead of \r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ndecorated_post = post.decorate\r\nComment.where(commentable_id: decorated_post.id, commentable_type:

much back(#11812) & fourth(90c450f), I think this is a good solution for people who would like to have a consistent order across various implementations .\r\n\r\nBy default `as_json` keeps the order by ruby engine which may be different on jruby vs mri. If you need to be fully sure that you always need a sorted hash whose order is consistent across all ruby implementations, use `sorted: true`.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Person\r\n    include ActiveModel::Serialization\r\n    attr_accessor :name, :age\r\n    def attributes\r\n      {'name' => nil, 'age' => nil}\r\n    end\r\n    def capitalized_name\r\n       name.capitalize\r\n    end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nperson.serializable_hash                # => {\"name\"=>\"bob\", \"age\"=>22}\r\nperson.serializable_hash(sorted: true) # => {\"age\"=>22, \"name\"=>\"bob\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nso basically, with `sorted` option we will get a alphabetically sorted hash which lot of people will find useful. \r\n\r\ncc: @guilleiguaran

preparing https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11855, it took me a\r\nminute to understand what was going on due to naming (parts refers first\r\nto an attr_accessor, then to a local, and is then reassigned), but also\r\nbecause the iterator conditionally builds nulls and then removes them.\r\n\r\nI refactored to something much more functional-looking that I find\r\neasier to read, but you may or may not. If you do, great! Enjoy! If\r\nnot, oh well, I tried. Can't win 'em all :)\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\n* no name conflict between local var and attr_accessor\r\n* no reassignment of local var\r\n* algorithm spelled out in steps\r\n* unused items in initial list filtered out early\r\n* empty-list case handled early instead of reassigning local var\r\n* no duplication of formatting strings (\"0 seconds\")\r\n\r\nBenchmarks (after PR #11855
