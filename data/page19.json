problem.\r\n\r\n**Rationale:**\r\n- #8831 - incorrect delivering valid JSON that contains nils in array(a lot of APIs are using that)\r\n- #8832 - error in `accepts_nested_attributes_for` with valid attributes\r\n- #8845 - regression with non-object JSON content\r\n- incorrect handling of `serialize` method([waiting for bug report](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/8832#issuecomment-12091767))\r\n\r\nThis is not partially bypassing bug like #8862, but the only valid and working solution - allow nils in arrays as JSON specification is saying.\r\n\r\nWe should work to fix design flaw in AR instead of breaking working standards.","created_at":"2013-01-10T12:45:34Z","updated_at":"2013-01-11T10:15:40Z","closed_at":"2013-01-11T04:40:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8decb2d88cb7dea2ed4d75211dc9623c434157c4","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8870/commits","review_comments_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8870/comments","review_comment_url":"/repos/rails/rails/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/8870/comments","head":{"label":"imanel:fix_json_params_regression","ref":"fix_json_params_regression","sha":"8d3cd95812b5816b28685a100912b4832f31cb65","user":{"login":"imanel","id":36869,"avatar_url":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/00c5bb4f96b1094aec27674a810caae6?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fc6429c03537e18407cf1e2d16f4af3c8.png","gravatar_id":"00c5bb4f96b1094aec27674a810caae6","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imanel","html_url":"https://github.com/imanel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imanel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imanel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imanel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imanel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imanel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imanel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imanel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imanel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imanel/received_events","type":"User"},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"rails:master","ref":"master","sha":"8c2e4b664e1dfabe2e892c75f5b6038f86eab982","user":{"login":"rails","id":4223,"avatar_url":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/30f39a09e233e8369dddf6feb4be0308?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Ff42a37d114a480b6b57b60ea9a14a9d2.png","gravatar_id":"30f39a09e233e8369dddf6feb4be0308","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails","html_url":"https://github.com/rails","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/received_events","type":"Organization"},"repo":{"id":8514,"name":"rails","full_name":"rails/rails","owner":{"login":"rails","id":4223,"avatar_url":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/30f39a09e233e8369dddf6feb4be0308?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Ff42a37d114a480b6b57b60ea9a14a9d2.png","gravatar_id":"30f39a09e233e8369dddf6feb4be0308","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails","html_url":"https://github.com/rails","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails/received_events","type":"Organization"},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails","description":"Ruby

discussion on #8630 I've checked HABTM against master and derivation of join table name works properly. But there's another thing here, if we change table name we'll want to see that foreign key will be changed too.\r\n```ruby\r\nmodule Namespace\r\n  class Base < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n    self.table_name = 'tablename'\r\n    has_and_belongs_to_many :somethings\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\nIn case above foreign_key for HABTM will be `base_id`, and for all associations we have to set it manually. I decided to add new option for it, this way we can set it for the whole class and descendants.

running tasks such \"rake db:setup\", instead of showing messages like\n\"db_development already exists\", it was showing a big stack trace and a\nmessage \"Couldn't create database for ...\" with the configuration options, a\nvery confusing message with a big trace.\n\nThis brings back the functionality present in 3-2, showing the same message.\n\nOutput of both mysql/postgresql:\n\n```shell\n./master-app [1.9.3-p327-perf]\n$ rake db:setup\nmasterapp_development already exists\nmasterapp_test already exists\n-- initialize_schema_migrations_table()\n...\n```\n\nAnd for sqlite3:\n\n```shell\n./master-app [1.9.3-p327-perf]\n$ rake db:setup\ndb/development.sqlite3 already exists\ndb/test.sqlite3 already exists\n-- initialize_schema_migrations_table()\n...\n```\n\nThese changes should hopefully handle the issue @rubys has been seeing\non master related to the rake tasks.\n\nI'm opening as a pull request to get some quick review before applying.\nLet me know about any

makes integer casting cover any non-castable case by returning `nil`, which is in-line with the intention of the former implementation in 3525a9b5, but covers the odd cases which respond to `to_i` but raise an error when it's called, such as `NaN`, `Infinity` and `-Infinity`. \r\n\r\nThose are the only ones I know of, but it's possible other objects could raise errors on `to_i`, which is the reason for the generic rescue. (Note that this generic rescue was also the behavior pre-3.2.8, except that the value was interpreted as a boolean instead—fixed in 96a13fc7—after this pull it will be more correctly and consistently interpreted as `nil`).\r\n\r\nFixes #8757 (see that issue for full

a production environment where the assets have been precompiled, we\r\ndon't want an assets compile step to happen on the application server at\r\nall. To ensure this, a js runtime may not be available on the app\r\nservers. In this environment, pages using javascript_include_tag for\r\nassets with non-standard or chained extensions were throwing 500 errors.\r\nFor instance, `javascript_include_tag('jquery.min')` would blow up.\r\n\r\nSprockets was attempting to build the assets being included during the\r\nrewrite_extension step (responsible for appending a '.js' extension to\r\nassets being included by the basename rather than a fully qualified\r\nname). This was happening as a step to resolve #6310, which required\r\nchecking for the presence of an asset with a non-standard extension\r\nbefore appending the extension.\r\n\r\nWe can check for the presence of an asset without invoking the asset\r\nbuild step by using Sprockets' resolve method, which will search for the\r\nbase file without building it (and is the method that find_asset uses\r\ninternally to get the path to the asset before attempting to build it).\r\n\r\nWhen rewriting the extension on an asset, these are the steps:\r\n- If the source does not have an extension, assume that the default\r\n  extension is desired and append it.\r\n- If there is an extension and it doesn't match the default extension,\r\n  check to see if a file with the precise name specified exists amongst\r\n  the assets; if it is present, do not append the default extension.\r\n  (This is the step that resolves #6310).\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis is a new pull of #6729 after github was confused
