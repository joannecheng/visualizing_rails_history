For example, we add new column and should this column for existing records. For do that you can use application  models:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nadd_column :users, :agree, :boolean\r\nUser.reset_column_information\r\nUser.update_all(:agree => true)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimple, but you need know `reset_column_information` method. Also if you decided change table_name to persons and model's name to Person this migration will raise exception and will no run.\r\nAnother, \"right\", way to solve problem of updating data in migration is using plain sql.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nexecute \"UPDATE users SET users.agree = 1\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis migration doesn't care about app models. So it will not fail if \"User\" model will not exist when migration will execute. But we all love activerecord because it converts ruby objects to db types, write and execute sql queries in more elegant way, automatically add a lot of useful methods based on table schema. So why we should not use it in migration?\r\nSo what about this solution:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nuse_table(:users).update_all(:valid => true)\r\n```\r\n\r\nMethod `use_table` creates unnamed activerecord model, sets table name and returns it's default scope. So we can fetch data, update it and etc.\r\nWhat do you think about it?","created_at":"2013-03-27T23:33:32Z","updated_at":"2013-04-05T17:34:38Z","closed_at":"2013-04-05T17:34:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"df641ffed8212e72a026e338a10d894960f3a022","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9959/commits","review_comments_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9959/comments","review_comment_url":"/repos/rails/rails/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/9959/comments","head":{"label":"kodolabs:master","ref":"master","sha":"8a34e57bfd6cd7ced2205a369aa0bef41f871d8e","user":{"login":"kodolabs","id":3046859,"avatar_url":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3e1c385322aec2dcf381d42548cce92f?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F64183d042b49ae8776a42cede3ddee53.png","gravatar_id":"3e1c385322aec2dcf381d42548cce92f","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kodolabs","html_url":"https://github.com/kodolabs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kodolabs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kodolabs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kodolabs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kodolabs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kodolabs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kodolabs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kodolabs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kodolabs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kodolabs/received_events","type":"Organization"},"repo":{"id":9062964,"name":"rails","full_name":"kodolabs/rails","owner":{"login":"kodolabs","id":3046859,"avatar_url":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3e1c385322aec2dcf381d42548cce92f?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F64183d042b49ae8776a42cede3ddee53.png","gravatar_id":"3e1c385322aec2dcf381d42548cce92f","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kodolabs","html_url":"https://github.com/kodolabs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kodolabs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kodolabs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kodolabs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kodolabs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kodolabs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kodolabs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kodolabs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kodolabs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kodolabs/received_events","type":"Organization"},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/kodolabs/rails","description":"Ruby

on feedback from https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9910)\r\n\r\nProblem I'm trying to solve:\r\n\r\nUsers of Rails Q API expect the Q system to be able to serialize and de-serialize the jobs they enQ.  If it's unable to do so, it should complain about it with an exact reason, at the time of enQ.\r\n\r\nMy take:\r\n\r\nThis problem can't easily be solved exclusively by the framework. Any attempt to do so fully would likely lead to a leaky abstraction wherein Job authors end up digging in to the guts of such an implementation.\r\n\r\nInstead, a simple and minimal contract should exist between Job objects and the framework responsible for enQ-ing and running them.\r\n\r\n1. a run method\r\n2. a serializable_hash method\r\n3. a from_serializable_hash method\r\n\r\nAdditionally:\r\n\r\nBackend job systems should have a choice on how to serialize jobs.  It's fine for Marshal to be the default in Rails, but it's unnecessarily restricting to impose this requirement on all integrators.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2013-03-25T18:03:45Z","updated_at":"2013-05-13T17:57:30Z","closed_at":"2013-03-25T18:57:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ad5e682af8ac5e4f4506a510f28a4cadb768b1b3","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9924/commits","review_comments_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9924/comments","review_comment_url":"/repos/rails/rails/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/9924/comments","head":{"label":"jacobo:jobs2","ref":"jobs2","sha":"3160fbe475e0e1ba64c78bb9e33ddc075890e36e","user":{"login":"jacobo","id":10033,"avatar_url":"https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/dc893f8ae12045dc71048a0c6a56fc01?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F10fa5eb83300e5f592b9b35a0e07fc3f.png","gravatar_id":"dc893f8ae12045dc71048a0c6a56fc01","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobo","html_url":"https://github.com/jacobo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobo/received_events","type":"User"},"repo":{"id":4119164,"name":"rails","full_name":"jacobo/rails","owner":{"login":"jacobo","id":10033,"avatar_url":"https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/dc893f8ae12045dc71048a0c6a56fc01?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F10fa5eb83300e5f592b9b35a0e07fc3f.png","gravatar_id":"dc893f8ae12045dc71048a0c6a56fc01","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobo","html_url":"https://github.com/jacobo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobo/received_events","type":"User"},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/jacobo/rails","description":"Ruby

#9740\r\n\r\nThis pull request introduces a new `UpgradeLegacySignedCookieJar` that is automatically used instead of `SignedCookieJar` when both `secret_token` and `secret_key_base` are present.\r\n\r\nCurrently, signed cookies generated by a Rails 3.x app will be invalidated by setting `secret_key_base`. This new cookie jar avoids this issue by transparently upgrading legacy signed cookies much like the `UpgradeSignatureToEncryptionCookieStore` does for legacy cookie-based sessions.\r\n\r\nI noticed this issue when upgrading Basecamp to Rails 4 and I've avoided setting `secret_key_base` pending a fix for this issue. \r\n\r\n@neerajdotname kicked things off and @jeremy provided some guidance along the way. Thank you!\r\n\r\n@spastorino asked to be notified when this pull request is ready, so here we go! \r\n\r\nThis PR also introduces a `ChainedCookieJars` module in response to this commit 2b773e148b56e0cff3b07ef1902311688fb9fed8. @jeremy suggested this would be an improvement in that is eliminates some duplication, and I agree. This ensures that chained cookie jars will always be initialized using the correct options. \r\n\r\n@jeremy and I also discussed and agreed that it makes sense to remove the `method_missing` calls introduced in that same commit as the methods have not been deprecated, but rather have simply been removed. I think the `method_missing` calls added unnecessary confusion -- better to just raise an exception which should be self-explanitory.  \r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nOn a somewhat separate note, @spastorino, I'd like us to consider tweaking the way that the session-based cookie upgrade process works. I'm thinking we could allow the user to leave their app configured to use `session_store :cookie_store` instead of asking them to change to `session_store :upgrade_signature_to_encryption_cookie_store`.\r\n\r\nI think we can assume that the user wants to avoid invalidating legacy cookies when upgrading. We can tell if someone is upgrading by the presence of the legacy `secret_token` . So, much like this PR does, perhaps we could detect this state and switch to using the new `upgrade_signature_to_encryption_cookie_store` automatically? \r\n\r\nLet me know what you think about this PR and about this possible additional improvement to the cookie-based session upgrade process. I'm happy to work up a PR for that separately, but I thought it would be smart to bring it up now.

folks,\r\n\r\nFirst of all, please bear in mind that this is my first pull request here. I've read the guidelines but I may have missed something, please point it out.\r\n\r\nI know this is a very small change, but I noticed some code in activemodel and activesupport require all files from a specific directory, but they files are sorted before, which does not seem to be useful or needed, and only cause a little overhead when booting rails.\r\nMoreover, the way the files are required is not consistent with the rest of the code.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think
