autoloaded in all-caps nestings are not getting marked as such by `ActiveSupport::Dependencies`. As a result they're not reloaded after modification when `cache_classes` is disabled. A failing test case is included.\r\n\r\nThis was because the originally requested constant name was not being passed to `#load_or_require`, so the expected location of the new constant had to be inferred from the path name using `String#camelize`. So if you autoloaded `HTML::SomeClass`, the watcher was told to look for new constants in `Html`, and none were found.\r\n\r\nI've fixed this by passing the qualified constant name to `#load_or_require`. This seemed to be the original intention behind the optional `const_path` argument to that method, which was previously unused.\r\n\r\nThe full build passes on the rails-dev-box - any feedback would be greatly appreciated. I've left the commits separate for review but will squash them if it's okay to merge.\r\n\r\nEdit: this bug affects 3.2, 4.0 and master - assuming it's okay to merge, please can it be considered for backporting to the older

Minitest's assert_raise so that it assert on the message.\r\n\r\nThere are 14 assertions in the test suite that assert that a particular exception is raised and its message. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately Minitest don't test the message part. This is by design (https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest/issues/99). So all those tests are red herrings. This commit fixes it by wrapping the `assert_raise` method and adding the message assertion.\r\n\r\nFor example, currently, in `activesupport/test/core_ext/hash_ext_test.rb` if you change the ` \"Unknown key: failore\"` to something else like `\"This should fail\"` it won't raise any error. I found this while I was working on https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11624\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n  def test_assert_valid_keys\r\n    assert_nothing_raised do\r\n      { :failure => \"stuff\", :funny => \"business\" }.assert_valid_keys([ :failure, :funny ])\r\n      { :failure => \"stuff\", :funny => \"business\" }.assert_valid_keys(:failure, :funny)\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    assert_raise(ArgumentError, \"Unknown key: failore\") do\r\n      { :failore => \"stuff\", :funny => \"business\" }.assert_valid_keys([ :failure, :funny ])\r\n      { :failore => \"stuff\", :funny => \"business\" }.assert_valid_keys(:failure, :funny)\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this commit, it will.\r\n\r\nYou can find all the red herring with this regular expression: `assert_raise\\(\\S*, \"`\r\n\r\nI added the method to the base helper of each project. Do we have a singular place where we could put this sort of

value.","created_at":"2013-07-23T12:42:20Z","updated_at":"2013-07-25T06:34:19Z","closed_at":"2013-07-24T15:53:58Z","merged_at":"2013-07-24T15:53:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"6b53ad089ec3e8e38c0b6c775750f48cb6d1c1f0","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11570/commits","review_comments_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11570/comments","review_comment_url":"/repos/rails/rails/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/11570/comments","head":{"label":"joelcogen:harmonize_text_field_and_area","ref":"harmonize_text_field_and_area","sha":"1424873948a98ab30ac4b5eed35d3de59a54b92a","user":{"login":"joelcogen","id":414090,"avatar_url":"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/89538ea8a44a4653b9d9953b71a70e34?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fa76175e3f099fbe9f548e78432ed4553.png","gravatar_id":"89538ea8a44a4653b9d9953b71a70e34","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelcogen","html_url":"https://github.com/joelcogen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelcogen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelcogen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelcogen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelcogen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelcogen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelcogen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelcogen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelcogen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelcogen/received_events","type":"User"},"repo":{"id":10098556,"name":"rails","full_name":"joelcogen/rails","owner":{"login":"joelcogen","id":414090,"avatar_url":"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/89538ea8a44a4653b9d9953b71a70e34?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fa76175e3f099fbe9f548e78432ed4553.png","gravatar_id":"89538ea8a44a4653b9d9953b71a70e34","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelcogen","html_url":"https://github.com/joelcogen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelcogen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelcogen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelcogen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelcogen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelcogen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelcogen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelcogen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelcogen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelcogen/received_events","type":"User"},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/joelcogen/rails","description":"Ruby

Rails 4 the default index page was moved from a static file `index.html` inside the `public/` folder to an internal controller/view inside of the railties gem. This was to allow use of erb in the default index page and to remove the requirement that new apps must delete a static file to make their index pages work. While this was a good change, the functionality was unexpected to developers who wish to get their apps running in production ASAP. They will create a new app `rails new my app`, start a server to verify it works, then immediately deploy the app to verify that it can start working in production. Unfortunately locally they see a page when they visit `localhost:3000` when they visit their production app they get an error page.\r\n\r\nWe initially anticipated this problem in the original pull request, but did not properly anticipate the severity or quantity of people who would like this functionality. Having a default index page serves as an excellent litmus test for a passed deploy on default apps, and it is very unexpected to have a page work locally, but not on production. \r\n\r\nThis change makes the default index page available in production if the developer has not over-written it by defining their own `root` path inside of

am getting this error when trying to run `rake db:test:prepare` in my application. The problem seems to be that I am using postgresql for development but sqlite3 for testing, and the method `enable_extension` is not defined in `Sqlite3Adapter` nor `AbstractAdapter`. As the schema is dumped from the dev database, the following code in `PostgresqlAdapter` (line 70)\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef extensions(stream)\r\n  return unless @connection.supports_extensions?\r\n  extensions = @connection.extensions\r\n  if extensions.any?\r\n    stream.puts \"  # These are extensions that must be enabled in order to support this database\"\r\n    extensions.each do |extension|\r\n      stream.puts \"  enable_extension #{extension.inspect}\"\r\n    end\r\n    stream.puts\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill always write the line\r\n\r\n`enable_extension \"plpgsql\"`\r\n\r\nin `schema.rb`\r\n\r\nThis patch simply adds an empty definition to prevent it. Another option to fix this would be to modify the schema dumper to write `enable_extension(\"plpgsql\") if supports_extensions?` instead. I can adapt the pull request to this if needed.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if this is intended or I am missing something, please let me know if there is a smarter way to fix it (or no need to fix it at all!). Also I am not sure what to test here, can someone point me in the right direction? Should I also modify the
