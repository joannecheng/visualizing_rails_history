is a resubmission of #10183.\r\n\r\n#10183 was merged and subsequently unmerged due to test failing for MySQL. \r\nComments [here](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/e8727d37fc49d5bf9976c3cb5c46badb92cf4ced#commitcomment-3047920)\r\n\r\nFor this one, I have incorporated the changes suggested by @rafaelfranca in c0a07af.\r\nThis change however still changes the schema inside the test and works around that by setting `use_transactional_fixtures` to `false` no matter which connection adapter is in use for that test class.\r\n\r\nIs this OK or would it be preferable for me to alter the actual schema (and corresponding models) by adding a unique index on a table there?\r\nI started down this path, but it quickly became more complex than I hoped (i.e. changing the existing schema breaking unrelated test).  I'll work through it though, if that is preferable.\r\ncc @jonleighton \r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nFrom original #10183 description:\r\n\"Per the comments in pull #3329, \r\nIf you have a table with a unique field index, and you mark a record for destruction, and you build a new record with the same value as the unique field, then when you call `save`, a database level unique index error will be thrown. \r\n\r\nThis happens because the record destruction happens after record creation.\r\n\r\nIn this pull request, I moved the record destruction ahead of the record creation.\r\n\r\nThis is my first pull request ever, so please go easy on me.  :smile:

adds the ability to define tables with primary keys which use PostgreSQL's native UUID type, which is pretty sweet :smile:.\r\n\r\nHowever, because PostgreSQL does not itself provide a usable default value or UUID generator function, the`PostgreSQLAdapter` implementation sets the default value to `uuid_generate_v4()`, which is a function provided by an external extension (`uuid-ossp`) that is not enabled by default in PostgreSQL (it is also not supported by some distributions of PostgreSQL—notably Heroku's [Postgres.app](http://postgresapp.com/)).  \r\n\r\nThis default can currently only be overridden by either passing another UUID generation function (which will also not be enabled by default), or passing an actual static UUID value, which is not appropriate for a primary key.\r\n\r\nThis patch allows the `:default` option on a table definition to be set to `nil`, which will set no default value.\r\n\r\nSetting the default value to `nil` will require you to always generate a UUID before saving a record (likely in a model's or concern's `before_save` callback), but it will at least allow you to use the UUID primary key feature without extensions or external libraries.\r\n\r\nI also tried to add a little documentation that will hopefully help people looking into this in the future.  Please let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions.\r\n\r\n*(Tagging @tenderlove, as this is the patch the he and I discussed in the rails-core mailing list.)*","created_at":"2013-05-01T21:44:25Z","updated_at":"2013-05-02T16:25:19Z","closed_at":"2013-05-01T23:22:35Z","merged_at":"2013-05-01T23:22:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"b3de9ea4088cda1b137091ff7389d78e3a8ed091","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10404/commits","review_comments_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10404/comments","review_comment_url":"/repos/rails/rails/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/10404/comments","head":{"label":"chadmoone:fix-pg-uuid-default","ref":"fix-pg-uuid-default","sha":"55c40c0ecec50936c439548b440216c62aa4ccbb","user":{"login":"chadmoone","id":149477,"avatar_url":"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/c446137299be4a0664a9bc5c18dedc18?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fd64f07b307b2dfecb0ca7fa127e4016b.png","gravatar_id":"c446137299be4a0664a9bc5c18dedc18","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chadmoone","html_url":"https://github.com/chadmoone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chadmoone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chadmoone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chadmoone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chadmoone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chadmoone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chadmoone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chadmoone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chadmoone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chadmoone/received_events","type":"User"},"repo":{"id":9532824,"name":"rails","full_name":"chadmoone/rails","owner":{"login":"chadmoone","id":149477,"avatar_url":"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/c446137299be4a0664a9bc5c18dedc18?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fd64f07b307b2dfecb0ca7fa127e4016b.png","gravatar_id":"c446137299be4a0664a9bc5c18dedc18","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chadmoone","html_url":"https://github.com/chadmoone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chadmoone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chadmoone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chadmoone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chadmoone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chadmoone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chadmoone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chadmoone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chadmoone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chadmoone/received_events","type":"User"},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/chadmoone/rails","description":"Ruby

of thinking of a Rails application as a class, we should instead try to start thinking of them as instances of a class. This class level abstraction makes sense when the Rails application is a singleton, but in the future if there are multiple applications per class, then it does not make sense to configure the entire class, but instead makes sense to configure a particular application instance.\r\n\r\nIn this vein, I've replaced the ``app_const`` with the canonical ``Rails.application``. The behavior should be the same, but this is a step in the direction of multiple applications.\r\n\r\nI've also allowed you to call ``configure`` on the instance instead of the class. Now, when the ``configure`` method is called on a subclass of ``Rails::Railtie``, the configure block is sent to the ``instance``.

great.","created_at":"2013-04-30T11:54:36Z","updated_at":"2013-05-01T06:42:19Z","closed_at":"2013-04-30T14:28:32Z","merged_at":"2013-04-30T14:28:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"dafaf60b46d6eba8b901edeb5524d1e9756bf85a","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10383/commits","review_comments_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10383/comments","review_comment_url":"/repos/rails/rails/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/10383/comments","head":{"label":"Noemj:bind_param_handling","ref":"bind_param_handling","sha":"9693df61f0143218da6f902021734441312f9d12","user":{"login":"Noemj","id":948418,"avatar_url":"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/907eb8b0459742d210a5f6020fcf3633?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Febc7e5975e50dd4e5fd644bb38e85fac.png","gravatar_id":"907eb8b0459742d210a5f6020fcf3633","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noemj","html_url":"https://github.com/Noemj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noemj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noemj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noemj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noemj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noemj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noemj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noemj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noemj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noemj/received_events","type":"User"},"repo":{"id":7870517,"name":"rails","full_name":"Noemj/rails","owner":{"login":"Noemj","id":948418,"avatar_url":"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/907eb8b0459742d210a5f6020fcf3633?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Febc7e5975e50dd4e5fd644bb38e85fac.png","gravatar_id":"907eb8b0459742d210a5f6020fcf3633","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noemj","html_url":"https://github.com/Noemj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noemj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noemj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noemj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noemj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noemj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noemj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noemj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noemj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noemj/received_events","type":"User"},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/Noemj/rails","description":"Ruby

Maybe-negligible regression in exchange for reduced complexity and three-order-of-magnitude performance improvement to a method.**\r\n\r\nThis couldn't be done when the code was written initially because Rails couldn't rely on the presence of these encoding methods without introducing a dependency on 1.9+.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour of this proposed version is identical to the current version in any case where a string has an internally-consistent encoding.\r\n\r\nIt differs where:\r\n\r\n1. A string is not a valid UTF-8 string (because it contains at least one ISO-8859-1/CP1252 byte); and\r\n2. The string also contains at least one UTF-8 multibyte character.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the UTF-8 characters will be reinterpreted as CP1252 bytes. This is in contrast to the current strategy which attempts to resolve a mish-mash of the two disparate encodings. This is demonstrated in the three commented-out tests in the diff.\r\n\r\nI normally wouldn't propose something like this, but this is a particularly slow method, and letting ruby handle it natively actually cuts 99.7% off of its runtime. It is my experience that the case this regresses on is very unusual, but I may be wrong on this.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","created_at":"2013-04-26T02:07:15Z","updated_at":"2013-05-08T16:55:57Z","closed_at":"2013-04-26T04:27:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0574f0cef51b8dc989e1882628d78af8b9072d1e","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10353/commits","review_comments_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10353/comments","review_comment_url":"/repos/rails/rails/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/10353/comments","head":{"label":"burke:master","ref":"master","sha":"da41bc48cf5e540ee9687c27b3c6ada808bb05d0","user":{"login":"burke","id":1284,"avatar_url":"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/cdc3fc7e6309a7989b6f5467670ec3cd?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F242c100dc94f871b6d7215b868a875f8.png","gravatar_id":"cdc3fc7e6309a7989b6f5467670ec3cd","url":"https://api.github.com/users/burke","html_url":"https://github.com/burke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burke/received_events","type":"User"},"repo":{"id":711737,"name":"rails","full_name":"burke/rails","owner":{"login":"burke","id":1284,"avatar_url":"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/cdc3fc7e6309a7989b6f5467670ec3cd?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F242c100dc94f871b6d7215b868a875f8.png","gravatar_id":"cdc3fc7e6309a7989b6f5467670ec3cd","url":"https://api.github.com/users/burke","html_url":"https://github.com/burke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burke/received_events","type":"User"},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/burke/rails","description":"Ruby

the fixture builder there was a single statement that inserts the fixture row and yields something like:\r\n\r\n    INSERT INTO table_name (\"arr_column\") VALUES ('{\"asdf\", \"as'df\"}')\r\n\r\nThe problem with this was that the single quote in the second array value needs to be escaped.  Normally they won't need to be escaped in strings, but when array columns go all the way to sql (instead of binding to the connection) they get wrapped in '{ and }' and that makes escaping them required.\r\n\r\nThis fix causes the insert to look more like:\r\n\r\n    INSERT INTO table_name(\"arr_column\") VALUES( $1 ) [ [\"arr_column\", [\"asdf\", \"as''df\"] ] ]\r\n\r\nThe extra single quote (') character is the escape for a single quote in a string. \r\n\r\nI made a test for this, to run the test:\r\n\r\n    cd activerecord && ARCONN=postgresql ruby -Itest test/cases/adapters/postgresql/array_test.rb -n test_insert_fixture\r\n\r\nTo see the test fail revert the change at https://github.com/cconstantine/rails/commit/0e34a7efa6992e6771d34dc8163b79dd7df52667#L0R35\r\n\r\nThis change is only in postgresql code, and everything passes when I run \r\n\r\n    ARCONN=postgresql rake test_postgresql\r\n\r\nThis is a followup to the failed attempt to fix https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10043
