commits adds a `disable_builtin_routes` configuration option to the Rails Application class, allowing the builtin routes (most importantly the default `/` route) to be disabled even in development mode.\r\n\r\n#### Why is this needed?\r\n\r\nMy CMS uses a dispatcher implemented as a middleware which dynamically routes CMS pages from the database. To ensure that content-managed pages cannot shadow routes defined by the developer, the dispatcher runs after the Rails application routes (checking for the `X-Cascade=pass` header).\r\n\r\nWith the Rails welcome page now implemented as a controller action, the route for `/` is always accessible in development mode, so the dispatcher cannot dispatch requests for `/`, meaning a CMS-managed home page cannot be

association, but will instead go to the database directly.\r\n\r\nI've changed this so that when a user calls ``find()`` on an association which has an ``:inverse_of`` flag, then the ``find_by_scan()`` method is called, which basically does a scan over the loaded_target (which includes all current children, including new and existing records).","created_at":"2013-03-03T18:23:31Z","updated_at":"2013-03-19T21:00:05Z","closed_at":"2013-03-19T21:00:05Z","merged_at":"2013-03-19T21:00:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"7e410a4f39dbb48925e54b64b53fad7f16efe3cd","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9529/commits","review_comments_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9529/comments","review_comment_url":"/repos/rails/rails/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/9529/comments","head":{"label":"wangjohn:find_on_inverse_of_bugfix_9470","ref":"find_on_inverse_of_bugfix_9470","sha":"840ca09a1151fafe1cb3299f12437378d25f2ce5","user":{"login":"wangjohn","id":1075780,"avatar_url":"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0f072cda8c91e247b8dd76fa1b10a64e.png","gravatar_id":"ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn","html_url":"https://github.com/wangjohn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/received_events","type":"User"},"repo":{"id":7698202,"name":"rails","full_name":"wangjohn/rails","owner":{"login":"wangjohn","id":1075780,"avatar_url":"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0f072cda8c91e247b8dd76fa1b10a64e.png","gravatar_id":"ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn","html_url":"https://github.com/wangjohn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/received_events","type":"User"},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/wangjohn/rails","description":"Ruby

you don't define ``inverse_of`` in an association, then you don't get the performance benefits of the inverse associations. However, these inverses can often times be guessed automatically. I'm adding functionality that will do some simple guesses if the ``inverse_of`` has not been set in an association.\r\n\r\nFor example, let's say we have two models Post and Comment:\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Post < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  has_one :comment\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Comment < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  belongs_to :post\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code I'm adding will automatically find that the post and comments are inverses of each other, so that the result is that the above code is equivalent to this:\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Post < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  has_one :comment, :inverse_of => :post\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Comment < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  belongs_to :post, :inverse_of => :comment\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that I've removed some tests which no longer make any sense (they were asserting that inverses were nil, but the new functionality means that they actually do find an inverse automatically).","created_at":"2013-03-02T22:01:44Z","updated_at":"2013-08-30T23:59:12Z","closed_at":"2013-05-08T03:52:39Z","merged_at":"2013-05-08T03:52:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"24ac2b91e4abf8310a368d13b92fa9e55fdf72dc","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9522/commits","review_comments_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9522/comments","review_comment_url":"/repos/rails/rails/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/9522/comments","head":{"label":"wangjohn:automatic_search_for_association_inverses","ref":"automatic_search_for_association_inverses","sha":"26d19b4661f3d89a075b5f05d926c578ff0c730f","user":{"login":"wangjohn","id":1075780,"avatar_url":"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0f072cda8c91e247b8dd76fa1b10a64e.png","gravatar_id":"ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn","html_url":"https://github.com/wangjohn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/received_events","type":"User"},"repo":{"id":7698202,"name":"rails","full_name":"wangjohn/rails","owner":{"login":"wangjohn","id":1075780,"avatar_url":"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0f072cda8c91e247b8dd76fa1b10a64e.png","gravatar_id":"ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn","html_url":"https://github.com/wangjohn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/received_events","type":"User"},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/wangjohn/rails","description":"Ruby

This prevents an unneeded database call if the records already exist in memory.\r\n\r\nThe new function scans the target of the association for the ids sent as inputs to ```find()```. The ids of the records that are found are removed from the ids which will be sent to the database.","created_at":"2013-03-01T06:30:35Z","updated_at":"2013-03-03T17:52:02Z","closed_at":"2013-03-03T17:52:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"50c425f54e27df0e0b62681b8c67746b3c74d479","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9503/commits","review_comments_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9503/comments","review_comment_url":"/repos/rails/rails/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/9503/comments","head":{"label":"wangjohn:find_on_inverse_of_bugfix_9470","ref":"find_on_inverse_of_bugfix_9470","sha":"2e41e84bda0d204f5364f739cb7977d8ae9e0608","user":{"login":"wangjohn","id":1075780,"avatar_url":"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0f072cda8c91e247b8dd76fa1b10a64e.png","gravatar_id":"ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn","html_url":"https://github.com/wangjohn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/received_events","type":"User"},"repo":{"id":7698202,"name":"rails","full_name":"wangjohn/rails","owner":{"login":"wangjohn","id":1075780,"avatar_url":"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0f072cda8c91e247b8dd76fa1b10a64e.png","gravatar_id":"ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn","html_url":"https://github.com/wangjohn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/received_events","type":"User"},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/wangjohn/rails","description":"Ruby

Overridden column defaults do not get marked as changed for new records, causing the locking column default to not get saved\r\n\r\n__Premise__: In `ActiveRecord::Locking::Optimistic#column_defaults` we set the default value for the locking column to `0` if it's not already set by the database.\r\n\r\n__Problem__: Due to the introduction of partial inserts @ 144e8691cbfb8bba77f18cfe68d5e7fd48887f5e, this overridden default will get ignored and never persisted to the database.  This results in the locking column having a `nil` value for new records.  The reason this happens is because `ActiveRecord::AttributeMethods::Dirty#keys_for_partial_write` will skip writing attributes that are not marked as changed.  When a new record's default attributes are set, the list of changed attributes is always assumed to be empty -- we don't actually check to verify that.\r\n\r\n__Solution__: When a new record's default attributes are set, *also* initialize the list of changed attributes by comparing current values against what's stored as the column defaults.  This initialization step intentionally does not use the `#column_defaults` helper since that's what's used by `ActiveRecord::Locking::Optimistic` to set the overridden default in the first place.\r\n\r\n__Verification__: Two existing locking tests have been modified to verify that they're locking column defaults are persisted to the database.  These tests were failing prior to this change.\r\n\r\nThis change will also fix other libraries that have been relying on this behavior.","created_at":"2013-02-28T14:47:53Z","updated_at":"2013-04-24T07:24:13Z","closed_at":"2013-03-24T22:42:50Z","merged_at":"2013-03-24T22:42:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"c686d09433a152af757c53f492b9d147c8ff4f91","assignee":null,"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/milestones/9","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/milestones/9/labels","id":44893,"number":9,"title":"4.0.0","description":"Changes

It's not easy for third-party libraries to make modifications to default attribute values in Rails 4; this is a proposed solution for that problem.\r\n\r\n__Disclaimer:__ I realize this may not be an accepted or recommended approach, but I'm throwing it out there to at least give it a shot.\r\n\r\n__Premise:__ As a third-party library developer, I have an API that allows Rails developers to ignore the default value in the DB defined for a column and override that default through an extension on ActiveRecord models.  There are a few reasons for this:\r\n\r\n1. To remain consistent across other ORM integrations -- the same (or similar) API is available in other ORMs like Sequel, DataMapper, Mongoid, etc.\r\n1. To remain consistent with where to define an attribute's default value for this library when the developer decides to switch to a more complex default such as one that gets determined dynamically at runtime (say based on other attributes initialized on a record).  For example, you could consider allowing the default to either be a static value (a string) or a dynamic value (a proc that defines the string at runtime).\r\n1. Although not as typical, to account for situations where the developer cannot change the DB default.\r\n\r\n__The existing solutions__:\r\n\r\n* Override #initialize and modify the `attributes` hash passed in.  This introduces issues for folks that have the attributed protected from mass-assignment.  If the attribute is protected, we need a different approach.\r\n* Define an `:after_initialize` callbacks. This is too late in the initialization process; it makes it difficult, if not impossible, to know if the developer has already manually overridden the default value either through the `attributes` hash passed in to `#initialize`, default scope attributes, or the `#initialize` block.  You would also want that default value defined at the same time as other column defaults in case the developer relies on the presence of that within the `#initialize` callback.\r\n* Extend `#initialize_attributes`.  This is used by more than just model initialization and is meant more as a post-processing hook, then a pre-processing hook.  There are several scenarios where this would break down, especially when `nil` is the value stored in the attribute for an existing record.\r\n* Extend and modify `#column_defaults`.  This was the solution for Rails 3.x and 2.x (via `#attributes_from_column_definition`).  However, in Rails 4 any modifications to `#column_defaults` get ignored because of the change to support partial inserts @ 144e8691cbfb8bba77f18cfe68d5e7fd48887f5e.\r\n* Override `#initialize` and `#initialize_dup` to mark `#{attribute}_will_change!`.  Together with the above solution (extending `#column_defaults`), *this solution works*.  However, it feels dirty -- it now leaks some of the knowledge of what ActiveRecord is doing under the hood.  This starts to feel more complicated than it ought to be.\r\n\r\nSo maybe the last bullet point is the right (and preferred) solution for this problem.  This pull request proposes a slight refactor to some of the code in `#initialize` that makes the solution even simpler.\r\n\r\n__Proposal__:\r\n\r\nIn this PR, the proposal is to introduce a `#default_attributes` method that gets used by `#initialize` to read the column defaults and run post-processing on those values.  By extracting it out into a method, it'll allow third-party libraries to extend it further with default overrides.  In addition, these changes will get written to the database on insertion in Rails 4 since they would marked as changed (from the column defaults).\r\n\r\nThe basic technique for extension would then be:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nmodule MyExtension\r\n  def default_attributes\r\n    defaults = super\r\n    defaults.merge!('some_attribute' => 'different_default_value')\r\n    defaults\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass MyModel < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  include MyExtension\r\n  \r\n  # ...\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nPhew!  Thanks for listening! So that's the gist of it.  Thoughts?\r\n\r\np.s. It's also worth noting how much this would likely simplify other libraries like
