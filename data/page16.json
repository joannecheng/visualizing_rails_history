pull request adds an easy way to create a javascript tag that listens to an EventSource. I have also added methods to create strings containing javascript for adding event listeners to a source.\r\n\r\nThis helps for adding streaming SSEs to a rails app. You can now call the ```event_source_tag``` function and create javascript. For example:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nevent_source_tag(\"sse_server\", {\"message\" => \"function(e) { console.log(e.data) }\"})\r\n```\r\nwill create a javascript tag with the following javascript code:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nif (!!window.EventSource){\r\n  var eventStream = new EventSource(\"sse_server\");\r\n  eventStream.addListener('message', function(e) { console.log(e.data) },

CSRF protection does not only apply to HTML/JS requests anymore (as\n far as I can tell)\n- CSRF protection is still fine to use with API requests and Rails\n supports this scenario through the X-CSRF-Token header. Updated the\n docs to reflect and explain this.\n\nI was going through the API docs for this while configuring Rails to\nwork with AngularJS and noticed that they suggest Rails ignores CSRF\ntokens on non HTML/JS requests. This does not appear to be the case\nanymore.\n\nAlso while I understand the reasons why CSRF is not really an issue for\nAPI requests, it does technically rely on secure implementations of the\nbrowsers (and possibly their plugins) to ensure that a site can't make\nXSS requests via AJAX. Since Rails easily supports submitting the CSRF\ntoken via a header I thought it might be worth adding that API\ndevelopers can do that if they prefer.","created_at":"2013-02-24T22:56:46Z","updated_at":"2013-08-25T15:07:38Z","closed_at":"2013-02-26T19:35:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3f7ee53d258f0b316cb9207f9d726a60c36cd4b9","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9405/commits","review_comments_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9405/comments","review_comment_url":"/repos/rails/rails/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/9405/comments","head":{"label":"chrisnicola:update-csrf-documentation","ref":"update-csrf-documentation","sha":"cfcd0c8c28e234ef1b04757411379e71d851366c","user":{"login":"chrisnicola","id":156449,"avatar_url":"https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/e2a523100c5d3d437a585962e7cfd625?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F90388c2eb2fb04b5f6aed006b56440a3.png","gravatar_id":"e2a523100c5d3d437a585962e7cfd625","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisnicola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/received_events","type":"User"},"repo":{"id":7061840,"name":"rails","full_name":"chrisnicola/rails","owner":{"login":"chrisnicola","id":156449,"avatar_url":"https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/e2a523100c5d3d437a585962e7cfd625?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F90388c2eb2fb04b5f6aed006b56440a3.png","gravatar_id":"e2a523100c5d3d437a585962e7cfd625","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisnicola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/received_events","type":"User"},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/chrisnicola/rails","description":"Ruby

believe the ActiveRecord::Base method update_attribute was intended to be deprecated in 4.0.  As you can see from the discussion here:\r\n\r\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rubyonrails-core/BWPUTK7WvYA/discussion\r\nand\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/commit/b081f6b59fb3f15d12043072ad9b331ffd2bc56e\r\n\r\nit was originally deprecated in 3.2 and removed in 4.0.  After that, I believe these changes were reverted so as to not deprecate functionality in patch releases:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/commit/81542f95d25825a7d3eff87d6f706661bf553b18\r\n\r\nHowever, I think the intent was still to have it deprecated in 4.0.\r\n\r\nThis pull request adds that deprecation.

\"get some feedback on this idea\" PR. Thanks @burtlo!\r\n\r\nIt's easy to forget what the order of things are in the routing table, especially if you're new. The HTML view has headings, but the console does not. They're a little different at the moment due to space, but I can change them to be as close to possible once we determine this is a good idea.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rake routes\r\n  Prefix Verb   URI Pattern              Controller#Action\r\n    foos GET    /foos(.:format)          foos#index\r\n         POST   /foos(.:format)          foos#create\r\n new_foo GET    /foos/new(.:format)      foos#new\r\nedit_foo GET    /foos/:id/edit(.:format) foos#edit\r\n     foo GET    /foos/:id(.:format)      foos#show\r\n         PATCH  /foos/:id(.:format)      foos#update\r\n         PUT    /foos/:id(.:format)      foos#update\r\n         DELETE /foos/:id(.:format)      foos#destroy\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne other thing I'd like to implement, but haven't: test if we're running in a shell or not. If we're not, then we shouldn't print the headings. If you're writing scripts that rely on the output of the task, no headings is way better.","created_at":"2013-02-18T18:47:41Z","updated_at":"2013-02-19T00:13:13Z","closed_at":"2013-02-19T00:03:29Z","merged_at":"2013-02-19T00:03:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"16c6970361962eb6150f45682ad3cd7f6f2f87d9","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9318/commits","review_comments_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9318/comments","review_comment_url":"/repos/rails/rails/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/9318/comments","head":{"label":"steveklabnik:router_headings","ref":"router_headings","sha":"a6277629faf48469ac5ea4f6899b44a213d88c9f","user":{"login":"steveklabnik","id":27786,"avatar_url":"https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/233c279c012ebac792aaa805f966cbc7?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0c22d45f31acf0f4192c8c12b7a55dee.png","gravatar_id":"233c279c012ebac792aaa805f966cbc7","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik","html_url":"https://github.com/steveklabnik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events","type":"User"},"repo":{"id":1950110,"name":"rails","full_name":"steveklabnik/rails","owner":{"login":"steveklabnik","id":27786,"avatar_url":"https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/233c279c012ebac792aaa805f966cbc7?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0c22d45f31acf0f4192c8c12b7a55dee.png","gravatar_id":"233c279c012ebac792aaa805f966cbc7","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik","html_url":"https://github.com/steveklabnik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events","type":"User"},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/steveklabnik/rails","description":"Ruby
