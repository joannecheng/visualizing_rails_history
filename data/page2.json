trying to run rails tests on JRuby, I noticed [LOT(more than 50) of failing tests](https://gist.github.com/gaurish/6206687) in ActionView'PolymorphicRoutesTest. noticed that nearly all of them failed because of errors related to AR:JDBC adapter, errors due AR 4's `exec_insert` not being well support, circular require warnings etc.\r\n\r\nI did some research & it turns out the the current version of AR:JDBC v1.2.7 is not well supported & has many bugs. Fortunately, thanks to a [recent fundraiser](https://www.bountysource.com/fundraisers/311-activerecord-jdbc-adapter-1-3-x/) there is a new version which fixes most of the known issues & provides better compatibility with AR 4 & things like `exec_insert`.  from their [README](https://github.com/jruby/activerecord-jdbc-adapter/blob/master/README.md):\r\n\r\n>Version 1.3.x of AR-JDBC adapter strives to provide ActiveRecord 4.x compatibility (as well as still supporting 2.3 and 3.x) from a single code base. It's a recommended update for all AR-JDBC 1.2.x users.\r\n\r\nthe full change is available [here](https://github.com/jruby/activerecord-jdbc-adapter/blob/master/History.md#130rc1-080313).\r\n\r\nafter this upgrade all tests in ActionView's `PolymorphicRoutesTest` are now green :green_heart: \r\n\r\ncc: @arunagw @steveklabnik @tenderlove \r\n\r\n#11700

For instance, a `SELECT` query will emit an event with a payload including `:operation => :select`.

is related to a [test](https://gist.github.com/gaurish/6189623) which currently fails on JRuby as JRuby's internal tables differ from MRI. \r\n\r\n**Issue**:\r\nthe order of attributes in json generated from `ActiveModel::Serializers::JSON#as_json` is dependant on MRI in such a way that any other ruby implementation can't pass this test.Because current implementation of `as_json` uses `ActiveModel::Serialization#serializable_hash` which in-turn uses `instance_values` from ActiveSupport to convert @variables of the model into a hash. The ordering of that hash is depending upon in ruby runtime's internal table and this is where the problem is.\r\n\r\nTo be more clear, here is an oversimplified example that showcases the root case behind the issue. Consider a `Contact` class:\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Contact\r\nattr_accessor :name, :age\r\nend\r\n \r\nc = Contact.new\r\nc.name = 'foo'\r\nc.age = 71\r\nputs \"order is #{c.inspect}\"\r\n```\r\nnow, lets run this on various Ruby implementations & notice the ordering of @variables.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n#MRI 2.0\r\n> ruby Contact.rb \r\norder is #<Contact:0x911de70 @name=\"foo\", @age=71>\r\n\r\n#JRuby 1.7.4\r\n> jruby --client Contact.rb \r\norder is #<Contact:0x1728f89 @age=71, @name=\"foo\">\r\n\r\n#rbx-head\r\n> rbx-head@global Contact.rb \r\norder is #<Contact:0xc @age=71 @name=\"foo\">\r\n``` \r\nAs you notice above MRI does `@name`, `@age` whereas JRuby & rbx do exactly opposite. What this means is, as we are using this ordering of @variables to generate the `attributes` hash, the order will vary according to ruby runtime. \r\n\r\nBased on the above, I  see 3 options \r\n\r\n1. Don't rely on internal tables of ruby runtime. Explicitly sort them on some basis e.,g alphabetical order\r\n2. Accept different ruby runtimes will have subtle difference. in which case, lets make this test specific to MRI & add another jruby & rbx. so order of json is still same but only if you use a same runtime.\r\n3. Stop caring about ordering. \r\n\r\n\r\nI personally think option 2 is good way to go as it allows us to maintain closest to order in which @variable were defined. so this PR implements that.

our company we have a lot of projects where we depend of controller and action (in our acl for example).\r\nIn basic case we can get it from params.\r\nBut sometimes we have situations where we need

options i need.\r\nNow, i decide to upgrade some of projects to rails4 and of course i get \r\n`undefined method hash_for_{any}_path`\r\nI find two way how i can fix it\r\n***\r\n```ruby\r\nRails.application.routes.recognize_path(any_path)\r\n``` \r\nSometimes its working. Thats good! But for actions that needed :id this method not working for me (i dont know about id in my acl)\r\n***\r\n2) Very ugly code like this\r\n```ruby\r\nRails.application.routes.routes.routes.find { |x| x.name == any_path }\r\n```\r\nI dont want to see this code. That's why this request here.\r\n\r\nIf this request is useless and no will be merged - can anyone to say me why hash access methods were removed?\r\n","created_at":"2013-08-08T12:46:51Z","updated_at":"2013-08-12T07:54:57Z","closed_at":"2013-08-11T12:14:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2702a96761807a48639a5d75ab3b9291dc108cf3","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11808/commits","review_comments_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11808/comments","review_comment_url":"/repos/rails/rails/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/11808/comments","head":{"label":"artempartos:feature/named_route_hash_access_methods","ref":"feature/named_route_hash_access_methods","sha":"5131b37388bbf9245d6be8c45678c92610753b2e","user":{"login":"artempartos","id":1943859,"avatar_url":"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/bee4d11bf7c1c69bce4f13978f566775?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7616a575f05a3e07d0af7f3c02fd0ce9.png","gravatar_id":"bee4d11bf7c1c69bce4f13978f566775","url":"https://api.github.com/users/artempartos","html_url":"https://github.com/artempartos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artempartos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artempartos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artempartos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artempartos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artempartos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artempartos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artempartos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artempartos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artempartos/received_events","type":"User"},"repo":{"id":11945701,"name":"rails","full_name":"artempartos/rails","owner":{"login":"artempartos","id":1943859,"avatar_url":"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/bee4d11bf7c1c69bce4f13978f566775?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7616a575f05a3e07d0af7f3c02fd0ce9.png","gravatar_id":"bee4d11bf7c1c69bce4f13978f566775","url":"https://api.github.com/users/artempartos","html_url":"https://github.com/artempartos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artempartos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artempartos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artempartos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artempartos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artempartos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artempartos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artempartos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artempartos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artempartos/received_events","type":"User"},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/artempartos/rails","description":"Ruby

we call `define_method` with non-english chars like `¿por qué?` it\r\nerrors out on JRuby as of `1.7.4` & would leave out the following error\r\n\r\n`invalid byte sequence in US-ASCII`\r\n\r\nFor more details, see the Bug reported:\r\n[JRUBY-7189 - invalid byte sequence in US-ASCII](http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JRUBY-7189)\r\n\r\nTo work around this issue, I have switched to define_method to define method name with US-ASCII & the index of the hash. the index was added because otherwise, ruby will raise method redefined warning.As far as I can see there are no side-effect of this change for other implementations. For readability I have added a message to `asssert_equal` informing for which word/phase the test has failed.\r\n\r\n**Before this Change**:\r\nJRuby: Tests terminated suddenly with an error about encoding . no report of Failues or errors\r\nMRI: All Green.\r\n\r\n**After this Change**:\r\nJRuby:the `ActiveSupport` TestsSuite gracefully fails with report at the end which test failed & why.\r\nMRI:All Green(no change)\r\n\r\nWith this, we are one More step closer to #11700!\r\n\r\nThanks to Thomas E Enebo from JRuby Core Team for [this

I have commit rights on docrails but open this pull request to make sure everything is right. Here are some notes:\r\n\r\n* The examples are using the root prompt since the sudo command [should be installed](http://www.freshports.org/security/sudo/). If you want me to update the examples with `sudo`, let me know.\r\n* I haven't put the commands for ports ; only for packages. However, there is the port's name in each case but I can update it if you want.\r\n* Finally, the PostgreSQL version is 9.2 in the patch but the `postgresql93-{client,server}` packages are available but it's [still a beta](http://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1471/).\r\n\r\nHave a nice
