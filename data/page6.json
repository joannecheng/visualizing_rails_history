https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10566 had to be reverted\r\nbecause after applying the fix test\r\n\"test_raise_record_not_found_error_when_invalid_ids_are_passed\"\r\nstarted failing.\r\n\r\nIn this test invalid_id is being assigned a really large number\r\nwhich was causing following failure when PR #10566 was applied.\r\n\r\n```\r\nRangeError: bignum too big to convert into `long long'\r\nSELECT  `interests`.* FROM `interests`\r\nWHERE `interests`.`man_id` = ?

In that\r\ncase the sql generate is following.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT `interests`.* FROM `interests`\r\nWHERE `interests`.`man_id` = ?

Can you comment if this PR ? It seems to me that having a smaller number does not change the intent of the test.\r\n\r\n/cc

existing implementation of the `noise` method in `ActiveSupport::BacktraceSilencer` does not work correctly if more than one silencer is configured -- specifically, it will only return noise which is matched by all silencers (which would be an unusual requirement to say the least :smile:), so often returns a rather useless `[]`.\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies the implementation such that anything that has been matched by silencers is removed from the backtrace using `Array#-` (array difference), ie. returns those elements within a backtrace that have been matched by any silencer.\r\n\r\nShout if

I notice ActiveSupport::Cache implementations behave differently when cache key is nil. \r\n\r\n```\r\ncache_key = nil\r\nRails.cache.write(cache_key, 'value')\r\nRails.cache.read(cache_key)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor example, FileStore raises a file system error \"No such file or directory\" when calling `write()` with nil cache key. This error **does not communicate what actually went wrong** (i.e. cache key cannot be nil). It took me a while to figure out when troubleshooting a production error.\r\n\r\nI added the failing tests in this pull request, and below is the test results. I wish to fix this issue, but I'm curious **what should be the expected behavior when cache key is nil?**\r\n\r\n| cache store | @cache.write(nil, 'value') | @cache.read(nil) |\r\n| ------ | ------- | ------ |\r\n| FileStore | raises \"Errno::ENOENT: No such file or directory\" | returns nil |\r\n| MemCacehStore | raises \"ArgumentError: key cannot be blank\" | raises \"ArgumentError: key cannot be blank\" |\r\n| MemoryStore | stored successfully |  returns the stored value |\r\n| NullStore | returns true | returns nil |\r\nFailing test results:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  1)

now when you start a server via `rails s`, the logger gets extended so that it logs to the file system and also to stdout. This extension behavior is not \"intelligent\" and if the default logger is already set to output to stdout, then the contents will be received twice.\r\n\r\nTo capture logs in accordance with http://www.12factor.net/logs some platforms require the logs to be sent to standard out. If a logger is set to stdout, and the server is started using `rails server` instead of another method (i.e. `thin start` etc.) then the app will produce double logs. \r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue by only extending the logger to standard out in the development environment. So that in production you don't get double logs like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nActionView::Template::Error (wrong number of arguments (5 for 4)):\r\n    1: <% lang_index = 0 %>\r\n    2: <div

else in ActiveRecord there's a clear association between the\r\n#distinct method and the DISTINCT sql statement.\r\nCollectionAssociation#uniq was not at all scope-like and rather returns\r\nan array, as #uniq does elsewhere in Ruby.\r\n\r\nIt was surprising to me that Author#comments.distinct wasn't chainable\r\nin that context, when it's chainable everywhere else, and the\r\nassociation is clearly backed by a sql statement. It's particularly strange\r\ngiven that these three uses of distinct have two different implications:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# DISTINCT-like\r\nclass Author < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  has_many :commentables\r\n  has_many :comments, -> { distinct }, through: :commentables\r\nend\r\nComment.joins(:author).where(author_id: Author.first.id).distinct\r\n\r\n# #uniq-like\r\nAuthor.first.comments.distinct\r\n```\r\n\r\nIMO overloading this behavior with #distinct's other behavior will\r\ncause confusion - better to provide these 2 behaviors separately.\r\n\r\nI thought about having different behavior when the target was loaded or\r\nnot, but the different return values (array vs relation) make that surprising too.\r\nIf there is a way to return a relation-like object in the loaded case, populated\r\nwith the #uniq records, that could be better.\r\n\r\nintroducing commit:
