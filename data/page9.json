[Rails 4 will require Ruby 1.9](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/e883c06a4f924cc4ba74efe4dad36394fad26fa0) and since Ruby 1.9 includes `json` in the standard library, `multi_json` is no longer necessary. I am a longtime maintainer of `multi_json` but [will stop supporting the library in June](https://github.com/intridea/multi_json/pull/113#issuecomment-17668823).\r\n\r\nThis patch replaces `multi_json` with stdlib `json`. It will use the `json` gem if a newer version is available.\r\n\r\nI have already submitted similar pull requests to [`execjs`](https://github.com/sstephenson/execjs/pull/126), [`sprockets`](https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets/pull/440), and [`uglifier`](https://github.com/lautis/uglifier/pull/51), so `multi_json` need not be a dependency of Rails 4 applications. This should have the effect of making JSON parsing and generation somewhat faster by removing an abstraction layer that is no longer necessary.","created_at":"2013-05-12T04:47:11Z","updated_at":"2013-08-12T08:11:41Z","closed_at":"2013-05-12T05:49:59Z","merged_at":"2013-05-12T05:49:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"54581bb933f0b7f904002ad89a0ace04c567b518","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10576/commits","review_comments_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10576/comments","review_comment_url":"/repos/rails/rails/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/10576/comments","head":{"label":"sferik:remove_multi_json_dependency","ref":"remove_multi_json_dependency","sha":"ce4456fde6f45f1abd020cbdeb520d401299e01f","user":{"login":"sferik","id":10308,"avatar_url":"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/1f74b13f1e5c6c69cb5d7fbaabb1e2cb?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F9efb1a59d7b58e69996cf0e32cb71098.png","gravatar_id":"1f74b13f1e5c6c69cb5d7fbaabb1e2cb","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sferik","html_url":"https://github.com/sferik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sferik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sferik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sferik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sferik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sferik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sferik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sferik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sferik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sferik/received_events","type":"User"},"repo":{"id":6783491,"name":"rails","full_name":"sferik/rails","owner":{"login":"sferik","id":10308,"avatar_url":"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/1f74b13f1e5c6c69cb5d7fbaabb1e2cb?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F9efb1a59d7b58e69996cf0e32cb71098.png","gravatar_id":"1f74b13f1e5c6c69cb5d7fbaabb1e2cb","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sferik","html_url":"https://github.com/sferik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sferik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sferik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sferik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sferik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sferik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sferik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sferik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sferik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sferik/received_events","type":"User"},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/sferik/rails","description":"Ruby

is an SQL improvement to ActiveRecord::Relation#blank?. Currently,\r\nit calls `to_a` on the Relation, which loads all records in the\r\nassociation, and calls `blank?` on the loaded Array. There are other\r\nways, however, to check the emptiness of an association that are far\r\nmore performant. `#empty?`, `#exists?` and `#any?` all attach a `LIMIT\r\n1` to the SQL query before firing it off, which is a nice query\r\nimprovement. `#blank?` should do the same! This is easily done by\r\nmaking `#blank?` an alias of `#empty?`.\r\n\r\nBonus performance improvements will also happen for `#present?`, which\r\nmerely calls the negation of `#blank?`\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: David Celis

Background\r\n\r\nI'm experimenting with a tweak to the controller pattern that supports putting each action into its own class inside of a controller module. So far the implementation has been very lean. One of my key changes has been to overwrite `#controller_path`, so that views will still be found in the same place. Another has been to delegate `#action` from the controller module to the individual action classes, so that route mapping doesn't need any changes.\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\nWhen I write tests against a controller's action class in my sample application, they consistently fail with a routing error. The tests have correctly inferred the `@controller`, but since `ActionController::TestCase::Behavior#process` contains a duplication of the `#controller_path` logic, the tests do not use my revised logic and so generate a path that does not match existing routes.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nPatching `ActionController::TestCase::Behavior#process` to use the canonical `@controller.class.controller_path` makes my tests pass.\r\n","created_at":"2013-05-05T18:20:23Z","updated_at":"2013-05-07T01:28:14Z","closed_at":"2013-05-07T01:12:14Z","merged_at":"2013-05-07T01:12:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"e1e322e6fa9b59987a49b6ff8bedc288ddcf4448","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10478/commits","review_comments_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10478/comments","review_comment_url":"/repos/rails/rails/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/10478/comments","head":{"label":"cainlevy:patch-1","ref":"patch-1","sha":"a145955fb7a7c3963453733b3fbac8a2c12a45d7","user":{"login":"cainlevy","id":4449,"avatar_url":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/2573ddee29779e76b7da7d3c2c9ff18d?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F5adaacd4531b78ff8b5cedfe3f4d5212.png","gravatar_id":"2573ddee29779e76b7da7d3c2c9ff18d","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainlevy","html_url":"https://github.com/cainlevy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainlevy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainlevy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainlevy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainlevy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainlevy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainlevy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainlevy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainlevy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainlevy/received_events","type":"User"},"repo":{"id":9869698,"name":"rails","full_name":"cainlevy/rails","owner":{"login":"cainlevy","id":4449,"avatar_url":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/2573ddee29779e76b7da7d3c2c9ff18d?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F5adaacd4531b78ff8b5cedfe3f4d5212.png","gravatar_id":"2573ddee29779e76b7da7d3c2c9ff18d","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainlevy","html_url":"https://github.com/cainlevy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainlevy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainlevy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainlevy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainlevy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainlevy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainlevy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainlevy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainlevy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainlevy/received_events","type":"User"},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/cainlevy/rails","description":"Ruby

Figured it was time to finally support it.\r\n\r\nOne question: should documentation be added suggesting an index on any column that `group_by` is being called on regularly?  I haven't seen those kinds of tips anywhere else in the documentation, but think it might be beneficial.","created_at":"2013-05-03T13:38:35Z","updated_at":"2013-05-30T06:24:08Z","closed_at":"2013-05-30T06:24:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"19bfea97f460a04a01480ce10a314f3753c6da0f","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10447/commits","review_comments_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10447/comments","review_comment_url":"/repos/rails/rails/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/10447/comments","head":{"label":"afeld:group_by","ref":"group_by","sha":"eacb28e696f0e688e8b43f196d7903f08eff7a3e","user":{"login":"afeld","id":86842,"avatar_url":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/5e6ceef905d14ade228ea22c445d57bc?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fcede5f0192bcfaaa44c2fabb5fa4f7a9.png","gravatar_id":"5e6ceef905d14ade228ea22c445d57bc","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afeld","html_url":"https://github.com/afeld","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afeld/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afeld/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afeld/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afeld/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afeld/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afeld/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afeld/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afeld/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afeld/received_events","type":"User"},"repo":{"id":9805795,"name":"rails","full_name":"afeld/rails","owner":{"login":"afeld","id":86842,"avatar_url":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/5e6ceef905d14ade228ea22c445d57bc?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fcede5f0192bcfaaa44c2fabb5fa4f7a9.png","gravatar_id":"5e6ceef905d14ade228ea22c445d57bc","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afeld","html_url":"https://github.com/afeld","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afeld/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afeld/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afeld/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afeld/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afeld/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afeld/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afeld/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afeld/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afeld/received_events","type":"User"},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/afeld/rails","description":"Ruby

a callback is added to the ``CallbackChain``, all of the callbacks in the chain are scanned to check if there are duplicates. I've changed the behavior of the callback chain so that this full scan only happens when the callback is an object filter.\r\n\r\nIn all other cases (which is the majority of cases), the ``CallbackChain`` implementation checks a hash of callbacks to see if there is a duplicate. This reduces the number of previous callbacks checked to just one per callback to be added.\r\n\r\nIn addition, adding the hash means that ``matches`` and ``duplicates?`` can be called much less frequently because the hash does the matching automatically.\r\n\r\nHere is a gist of the performance before and after this change:
