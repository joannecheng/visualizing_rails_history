if `config.action_dispatch.x_sendfile_header` is not set Rails will never take advantage of the `X-Sendfile-Type` header informing it whether to use `X-Sendfile` or `X-Accel-Redirect` or no such acceleration, since it doesn't even load `Rack::Sendfile`.\r\n\r\nBy always loading `Rack::Sendfile` we make the docs actually correspond to reality:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/guides/source/3_1_release_notes.md#action-dispatch\r\n> config.action_dispatch.x_sendfile_header now defaults to nil and config/environments/production.rb doesn't set any particular value for it. This allows servers to set it through X-Sendfile-Type.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionpack/lib/action_controller/metal/data_streaming.rb#L18\r\n> Your server can also configure this for you by setting the X-Sendfile-Type header.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionpack/lib/action_controller/metal/data_streaming.rb#L78-L80\r\n> Avoid having to pass an open file handle as the response body. Rack::Sendfile will usually intercept the response and uses the path directly, so there is no reason to open the file.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo clearly Rails was meant to autodetect whether or not to use a `X-Sendfile`/`X-Accel-Redirect` header without forcing the user to specify which header to use.\r\n\r\n(By setting `x_sendfile_header` to any value `Rack::Sendfile` gets inserted in the middleware chain, but the value of `x_sendfile_header` is always used as the `X-Sendfile-Type` variant, thus breaking automatic configuration by the web server. With this pull request not setting `x_sendfile_header` makes Rails/Rack autodetect which header to use, while the user can explicitly force a certain header by setting `x_sendfile_header` to e.g. `X-Sendfile`)","created_at":"2013-07-14T18:30:10Z","updated_at":"2013-07-15T08:16:39Z","closed_at":"2013-07-15T04:23:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0797b1602a887f1ec9ac0509a177ad2aa5f78c8f","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11440/commits","review_comments_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11440/comments","review_comment_url":"/repos/rails/rails/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/11440/comments","head":{"label":"MSch:auto-sendfile","ref":"auto-sendfile","sha":"17cc6f42e3fd883655410cf26dcf404275de9156","user":{"login":"MSch","id":7475,"avatar_url":"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/64afebe5db598b0b043f35560bf940df?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fc73071b4520a9a82990741a84a2144eb.png","gravatar_id":"64afebe5db598b0b043f35560bf940df","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MSch","html_url":"https://github.com/MSch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MSch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MSch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MSch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MSch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MSch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MSch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MSch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MSch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MSch/received_events","type":"User"},"repo":{"id":10698959,"name":"rails","full_name":"MSch/rails","owner":{"login":"MSch","id":7475,"avatar_url":"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/64afebe5db598b0b043f35560bf940df?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fc73071b4520a9a82990741a84a2144eb.png","gravatar_id":"64afebe5db598b0b043f35560bf940df","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MSch","html_url":"https://github.com/MSch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MSch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MSch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MSch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MSch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MSch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MSch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MSch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MSch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MSch/received_events","type":"User"},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/MSch/rails","description":"Ruby

PR is a continuation of https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11032.\r\n\r\nI've moved all the rendering-related code to `ActionView` and added to its `railties` code that hooks all necessary things to `ActionPack` if the AV is loaded.\r\n\r\nAs straight forward as it sounds, it turned out it's not that easy. In the AP, all its components needs to be loaded in order. This introduced huge complication with loading AV stuff in railties as it was included at the end and needed to be included somewhere in the middle.\r\n\r\nAfter discussing this issue with @drogus and @josevalim we agreed on simple solution - https://github.com/strzalek/rails/blob/fc89313fe3f9e508dbe84616fa9a91db123337b0/actionpack/lib/action_controller/base.rb#L164-168\r\n\r\nWith this code, we're now able to load `AV::Rendering` **between** `AbstractController::Rendering` and `ActionPack::Rendering` simply by:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nActionPack::Base.superclass.send(:include, ...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR is subject to discussion and WIP, not final solution.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts? Maybe you have other ideas how to abstract `ActionView` ?\r\n\r\nTODOS:\r\n\r\n* [x] `--skip_action_view`\r\n* [x] changelog\r\n* [x] deprecations (if any)\r\n* [x] Create `BasicRendering` implementing only `render text:`\r\n* [x] Create public API method `rendering_format` in controller\r\n* [x] Create ActionPack integration tests for ActionView\r\n\r\n/cc @drogus @josevalim @jeremy

the `AppGenerator` is started, `ARGV` needs to be modified to correctly account for some things (like showing the version). I'm extracting these out into their own class, and moving this class inside of the same file that defines `AppGenerator`. \r\n\r\nRight now, the preparation done by the `AppPreparer` class is done inside of the `commands/application.rb` file and it is thrown together in a hacky manner. I think instead of putting this logic in the `commands/application.rb` file (which in my opinion should only make a call the requisite classes), the `AppPreparer` should be extracted some place which is reasonably close to the `AppGenerator` class.

one adds some more flexibilty AR when it comes to work with legacy databases. Several other frameworks use the 'inheritance' column and it would be fine to have AR able to understand those strings as well and translate to the appropriate AR models. \r\n\r\nThis allows you to specify the string which maps to the current model, for instance: \r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass LegacyPost < LegacyContent \r\n    self.inheritance_name = '_name_used_by_other_framework' \r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is working for me in a project I'm currently working on and I think it would e a nice and simple addition to AR. \r\nIf anybody thinks it's worth I can go ahead and work out
