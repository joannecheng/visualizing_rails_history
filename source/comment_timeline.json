However, as of PostgreSQL 9.1, the default is on, meaning that backslash escapes are recognized only in escape string constants. This behavior is more standards-compliant, but might break applications which rely on the historical behavior, where backslash escapes were always recognized. As a workaround, you can set this parameter to off, **but it is better to migrate away from using backslash escapes**.  If you need to use a backslash escape to represent a special character, write the string constant with an E.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause of the bolded part of the docs above I'm not entirely comfortable putting in backslashes to escape the quote characters, but there is another option; I could recursively call back into quote and have the normal quoting system handle converting the ruby object into a postgres compatible string literal.  I've tested this approach and it works too.  Also, the existing string quoting system appears to do what this change does.  \r\n\r\nOn a related note, I there might be a separate issue related to escaping the backslash character.  When I put a backslash in one of the strings in the test array they disappear after going to the db.  This happens when I gsub in another quote character and when I use a recursive quote call.

If you want to find a record in the association collection, you can use `find/detect/select/find_all` with a block. Also, at a glance it seems the code is calling `load_target` every time, which might load the full association for a simple `find` call, when no associated records are necessary.\r\n\r\nSo I think we'd be good if only setting the inverse association on `find` was improved, but I would rather not change `find` in Rails with this logic.\r\n\r\nThanks for your contribution :)","merged":false},{"ts":1362333122000,"body":"@carlosantoniodasilva Ok, ya that makes sense.

Are you sure there isn't room for a bit more discussion on this one before closing it?\r\n\r\nLeaving aside the discussion of whether `where.<predicate>` is a good idea for the API for a moment, I'm concerned that we're locking ourselves in to a specific implementation before it's needed. It would be easy to at some point alter a `where_not` implementation to use a WhereChain and transition people to `where.not` should that API design prove useful for other predicates in the long run. As it sits, we're adding complexity to the `where` method, adding another class, and sending to private methods on the parent in order to make it all work, for something that people might extend in the future.\r\n\r\nBack in the AR 3.x days, we supported only equality (and, for certain value types, IN/BETWEEN). There was a good deal of discussion around what a more full-featured API for creating other ARel predicates might look like, among them @lifo's SuperCondition implementation, which formed the basis for MetaWhere at the time. The suggestion at the time was that we would take a look at what plugins were developed and seemed to be most useful and at some point in the future consider selecting one for integration into core.\r\n\r\nHere we are, 3 years later, and as best I can tell that isn't what is happening here. I haven't seen the implementation we've gone ahead with extensively tested in plugin form, but we're integrating it all the same. As such, I'm disappointed to see additional complexity in an implementation with the promise of some potential future ecosystem developing around it driving additions to core, when that has historically not been the case for the AR query API.\r\n\r\nGiven that I have skin in the game, here, I should clarify that I'm not necessarily saying that we *need* to implement Squeel's version of predicate building. I know it may not be for everyone. But I am saying that I built both MetaWhere and Squeel as proofs-of-concept based on the expectation that they would be included in the running for an eventual enhanced query builder API, and they have received far more real-world usage than the API we've landed on.\r\n\r\nMy last attempt at driving some discussion around this was at https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rubyonrails-core/evUmld2Mal4/PGFLjX9ZeNkJ and met with a lackluster response.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, these are the drawbacks I see with this approach at first glance:\r\n\r\n* Alteration of types (both duck- and actual) throughout a method chain, making order of messages being sent important where it previously was not\r\n* Existing methods for relation composition map closely to the query domain, mapping to specific clauses of the query for this most part. `where.not` (or, for that matter, `where_not`) breaks this trend\r\n* Should the pattern be extended to other predicates, we find ourselves chunking our where clauses by type of predicate instead of by related concept or attribute, or reverting back to string queries. The likelihood that scopes will hide this fact from typical application use cases does not prevent it from having a certain smell.\r\n* The implementation as it sits today is awkward (injecting the previous scope, sending to its private `build_where` method, and branching based on a number of possible return types then mutating and returning the injected scope), and we should stop to consider whether the feature envy is telling us something.","merged":false},{"ts":1362612966000,"body":"No?

As an example, let's assume we have `User`, `Team` and `TeamUser` models. The `TeamUser` has belongs_to relationship both a user and a team and both the user & team models are linked to each other through the team user model. When we create a new `User` we want to assign it to a number of teams so we do this:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nuser = User.new\r\nuser.teams << Team.find_by_name(\"Admin\")\r\nuser.save\r\n```\r\n\r\nYour proposal means that the `TeamUser` object would be created at line two before the user exists which means the `user_id` column of the `TeamUser` object would be nil which is not valid in this scenario. \r\n\r\nWhen assigning objects in this manner before the object is actually created, I believe the current behaviour of creating these \"join\" objects after the original object has been saved is correct. \r\n\r\nIn my specific use case, I often add a validation on the join model to ensure that both parts of the association belong to the same account (in a multi-tenanted system). For example:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass TeamUser < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  belongs_to :team\r\n  belongs_to :user\r\n  validate do\r\n    if team.account_id != user.account_id\r\n      errors.add :base, \"The team & user must belong to the same account\"\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nDo you have any thoughts on this and how this would be achieved if the model initialised, validated & saved without one of the foreign keys?","merged":true},{"ts":1357927580000,"body":"Also, when is 3.2.12 due out?\r\n\r\nWould it, perhaps, be worth releasing this sooner rather than later to avoid confusion by people upgrading to 3.2.11 because of the recently security announcements?

Look, I don't really care if the URL ends up with \".json\" or not.

So, the first time the action would respond with content-type 'application/json' but next time it would be 'text/html' if I remember correctly. Then I have been told that the cached action will use the content-type based on the format of the request, so I can't use \"format: false\". And the reason why I want to enforce the format is so that I don't forget about it in my client-side applications when calling some action with jQuery.getJSON (which won't run the callback if the wrong content-type is served). Sorry if this is confusing but I couldn't find any way to simplify that...

We delegate a lot, and missing data inevitably results in delegation targets that are nil. For critical user facing elements, we sometimes rescue in the controller or the view.

Some feedback:\r\n\r\n1. I remember there is/was an `.unscoped` method (as opposed to `.unscope`, note the ending 'd') - is/was there a difference between the two? Isn't the whole point of `.unscoped`/`.unscope` to remove the default scope - otherwise what's the use of that method at all?\r\n2. I agree that `.unscope`/`.unscoped` should remove/override `default_scope`, but not sure whether the same should apply to `.except`. I could argue that `.except` is used to override/customize other \"normal\" (e.g. not \"default\") scopes, such as those inherited from superclasses, and `.default_scope` should be as transparent to `.except` as it is to other clauses; to override a `.default_scope`, explicit `.unscope`/`.unscoped` should be used in addition or instead of `.except`, as required.\r\n3. If there is a desire for flexibility of `.unscope` to only remove some clauses such as `.where` but not others, I think `.unscope` should take array/varargs arguments that specify which clauses should be removed:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nUser.unscope(:where).where(...) # replace existing `.where` scopes but preserve other existing scopes.\r\n```\r\n\r\nRight now there are some custom method that do this, such as `.reorder` (which drops existing order clauses before setting new ones) as opposed to `.order` (which appends clauses without removing old ones), and I always felt that led to method sprawl and wasn't friendly to new users who didn't now the intimate details of all the API. I'd rather have a more explicit way of removing or replacing existing scopes (such as above `.unscope` with arguments).","merged":false},{"ts":1371476528000,"body":"@egilburg, thanks for the feedback.\r\n\r\n1. `.unscoped` still exists. It removes the default scope.\r\n2. I don't expect a method called `.except` to ignore the default scope. I think acting on the default scope should be `.except`'s default behavior. If people want to override that behavior, perhaps an option should be passed, e.g. `User.except(:where, with_default_scope: false)`\r\n3. `.unscope` already works like I think you suggested, e.g.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nUser.where(awesome: true).order('age DESC').unscope(:where, :order).order('age ASC').to_sql\r\n# => \"SELECT \\\"users\\\".* FROM \\\"users\\\"   ORDER BY age ASC\"\r\n```","merged":false},{"ts":1372143964000,"body":"As per discussion on https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/10643 in 4.1 default_scope would be applied first.

At the end of the day, AP and AV are still closely tight together and 95% of the project or maybe even more will be always using rails with AV.\r\n\r\nHowever, almost all of the tests concerning ActionView were moved away from AP to AV, and you can find them as integration ones in `actionview/test/actionpack` (https://github.com/strzalek/rails/tree/extract_renderers/actionview/test/actionpack). Notice that AV has also dev dep on AP as it needs stuff from there.\r\n\r\nBesides that, in `railties` you can find `basic_rendering_test.rb` (https://github.com/strzalek/rails/blob/extract_renderers/railties/test/application/basic_rendering_test.rb) which is end-to-end test, checking if rails application without AV works as supposed. (it generates full rails app, makes few changes to files and setup, runs it and checks what was rendered).\r\n\r\nThat's how it is now. I think that AV should stay as dev dep on AP for now. We have quite good coverage to be sure if stuff with/without AV works properly. Maybe it'll change some time in the future, during the process of refactoring tests, because I must admit, in some places you can find huge mess in there.\r\n\r\nHope that explains everything, @egilburg.

(I also don't think that [W3 Schools](http://www.w3schools.com) is a valid reference, as argued [here](http://w3fools.com/).) \r\n\r\nThe definition, as you state it, is mostly correct, but incomplete. As noted in the (SitePoint Reference)(http://reference.sitepoint.com/html/img/alt), \r\n\r\n>[If] the user is visually impaired and is accessing the content using a screen reader—the alt \r\n>attribute provides alternative content that can be displayed instead of the image.\r\n\r\n[456 Berea St](http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200412/the_alt_and_title_attributes/) also has a good write up on the alt tag and its use in screen readers. And the [W3 specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/objects.html#adef-alt) mentions other use cases, primarily focused on accessibility, not instances where the image won't load:\r\n\r\n>Specifying alternate text assists users without graphic display terminals, users whose browsers don't support forms, visually impaired users, those who use speech synthesizers, those who have configured their graphical user agents not to display images, etc.\r\n\r\nThus, screen readers are my primary concern, as noted in the pull request title, because I think accessibility is important. So the reason I mention Voice Over is twofold: \r\n\r\n1. The current implementation is broken in Voice Over\r\n2. That was the screen reader with which I tested it\r\n\r\nFurther, I didn't need to test it in any other screen readers because it was broken on Apple computers, a significant enough portion of the market that, even if this worked on every other screen reader, it would still need fixing for Apple's Voice Over.\r\n\r\nLastly, in the other use cases that you correctly point out, if the image doesn't display, the text should describe the image, and a long, hyphenated and capitalized string doesn't work well for that case, either. \r\n\r\nSo whatever the reason that an `alt` attribute is being displayed, whether it's by a screen reader, because the user is using a headless web browser, because the image path is incorrectly specified, because the user has a slow connection and it hasn't rendered yet, or any other reason, this description needs to read like a normal phrase.\r\n","merged":true},{"ts":1360445919000,"body":"Can you squash please?","merged":true},{"ts":1360538791000,"body":"Squashed.

From what I can see it looks possible to do things this way, but I think we would need to have a `ActiveRecord::*` exception raised rather than `NoMethodException` on calling `to_i`. We could then have `populate_with_current_scope_attributes` silently ignore just that exception when it tries to set an attribute.\r\n\r\nThe big benefit of that approach is that `post.category_id = Category.find(1)` would fail with an exception, but `Post.where(:category_id => [ 1, 2 ]).new` would work correctly.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?

I do think rails' use of rake is suboptimal and has room for improvement, but that's more nuanced than fits in a tweet.\r\n* I haven't worked on a rails app in a long time (I've never used rails 3.1 or 3.2, for example, and barely used rails 3.0). The apps I've been working on are very, very far from rails-style CRUD apps, and, as @dhh has [stated elsewhere](http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2012/the-parley-letter.html), the more your app is dissimilar from Basecamp, the worse fit rails is for your application.  I'm not sure if/when I'll be working on another rails app, so I'm not going to invest lots of time in an extended discussion here.\r\n\r\nWith that said, I think there's an optimal way to use rake that's quite different from how rails uses it.  Specifically, it leverages the fact that rake, like most ruby programs, has two run-time phases:\r\n\r\n* Phase 1 is \"task definition time\" -- during this phase, rake is evaluating your `Rakefile` (which involves loading other files `require`d or `load`ed by your Rakefile).\r\n* Phase 2 is \"task execution time\" -- during this phase, rake is executing the specified task(s).\r\n\r\nMy preferred way to use rake is to make phase 1 as lightweight and minimal as possible.  My rule of thumb is to only require files that define rake tasks during this phase, and to defer all other requires to phase 2.  Each task becomes responsible (either through the code directly in the task, or via a prerequisite task) for loading the files and libraries it needs to run.  This goes hand-in-hand with [the way I use bundler](http://myronmars.to/n/dev-blog/2012/12/5-reasons-to-avoid-bundler-require), and fits right in with my preferred approach of explicitly loading dependencies at runtime...but I know that [DHH prefers](https://twitter.com/dhh/status/281106285024407552) the convenience of not having to manually manage dependencies at runtime.  (As usual, this is about trade offs.  The particular things I value most differ from the things DHH values most and that's fine).\r\n\r\nRails has, for as long as I know, chosen to load the entire rails environment at task definition time, which essentially causes the environment to be double-booted when running a task that spawns a new process that boots the environment.  Changing to my preferred approach would be a large change, but if there's desire to move in that direction, a major release (like rails 4) is the right time to do it.  As a point of comparison, here's the kind of speed I get out of rake.  This is on a large app that I (and an entire team at @seomoz) have been working on full time for 9+ months:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ time bin/rake -T > /dev/null\r\nbin/rake -T > /dev/null  0.21s user 0.04s system 98% cpu 0.255 total\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's 255 ms wall clock time, which is barely noticeable.\r\n\r\nAs for the idea of having a more full-featured test runner...I heartily support such a thing (one of my favorite parts of rspec is the super flexible test runner, complete with the binary that supports a plethora of options), but I wonder if it's better suited as an external gem that can be used by any T::U/minitest project?  Is there anything about this that needs to be coupled to rails?","merged":true},{"ts":1359243914000,"body":"> Calling rails use of rake a \"misuse\" has more to do with twitter-imposed terseness than with the actual way I would categorize it.

In attempting to make the test I realized I really didn't understand what was going on.  The problem stems from the way the insert statements were built and used.  \r\n\r\nIn the fixture builder there was a single statement that would insert the fixture row and would yield something like:\r\n\r\n    INSERT INTO table_name (\"arr_column\") VALUES ('{\"asdf\", \"as'df\"}')\r\n\r\nThe problem with this was that the single quote in the second array value would need to be escaped.  Normally they won't need to be escaped in strings, but because the array syntax starts with '{ you need to escape them in array contexts.\r\n\r\nNew ActiveRecord::Base models get inserted into the database more like this:\r\n\r\n    INSERT INTO table_name(\"arr_column\") VALUES( $1 ) [ [\"arr_column\", [\"asdf\", \"as'df\"] ] ]\r\n\r\nThis isn't exactly the SQL that is transferred, that array on the end is sent to the DB as a binding of some kind. This is the command you see recorded to the rails log when a model insert happens.\r\n\r\nThe new fix in be4318b doesn't attempt to escape the ' character anymore, instead it uses the existing postgres insert code used for inserting models with the bound column values.  This is less dangerous as it only effects the code in insert_fixture (which only runs during test setup).  I pulled the method into the PostgreSQL specific driver because I'm not sure it will work with the other db engines and fixture loading appears to be completely untested; I couldn't find any tests that call insert_fixture.  \r\n\r\n\r\n","merged":true},{"ts":1365409612000,"body":"Thanks for the update and the test-case.

E.g., docs of certain sizes will blow out memory in `json` but work with a very reasonable footprint in `yajl`.  And `json` has deliberately hard-coded a depth limit in nested structures.  I'd imagine that was done as a stop-gap to blowing out memory, but it's not an accidental bug.  The error message very clearly tells you it will not parse that document (see: https://github.com/flori/json/blob/master/lib/json/common.rb#L119).\r\n\r\nThat aside, even if it could subsume all other JSON processors in some future release, then you'd have to require a version not bundled with stdlib anyway, kinda negating the purported benefit of this being bundled in stdlib.","merged":true},{"ts":1368625137000,"body":"@nirvdrum That's a fair point, I hadn't considered that.

Regardless of the rationale, the point I was raising is that `json` is not a drop-in replacement for other providers but the ActiveSupport interface is going to look the same and as a result code that previously worked no longer will.  My preference is to retain the ability to swap out the engine, whether that be with multi_json or by other means.  But, barring that, I think it's misleading to indicate that a multi_json-like lib is no longer necessary and thus safe to remove.

That was little unfortunate to address really serious bug(CVE-2013-0156) in the same release that is breaking a lot of applications(not to mention JSON specification) So from my point of view it's much more important to deliver working version and patch more important bug.\r\n\r\nAfter we finish doing that then we should start thinking about how to fix CVE-2013-0155.","merged":false},{"ts":1357834125000,"body":"Agree, but since we will not do another release without fixing CVE-2013-0155 too, I think you can use your fork now.","merged":false},{"ts":1357835662000,"body":"BTW, I really don't recommend to use in your application this revert, unless you did the workaround.

Correct code:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nunless params[:token].blank?\r\n  user = User.find_by_token(params[:token])\r\n  user.reset_password!\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would allow revert at least part about changing empty array and empty hash to nil(probably biggest problem and cause of #8832)\r\n\r\nThe only remaining problem is `[nil]` structure and this still need to be handled by JSON, as it is perfectly valid one. The problem is not with allowing such structure pass JSON decoding, but combination of passing through `blank?` and converting to NULL in ActiveRecord. Let's split problem to 2 parts:\r\n\r\n1. ActiveRecord will convert `User.find_by_token([nil])` to `WHERE token IN (NULL)`, which is **valid** - we are using it and preventing it would be confusing\r\n2. [nil].blank? returns false. This probably need to remain unchanged, as this array surely is not `nil?` or `empty?`\r\n\r\nSo using just this two cases we can't resolve this bug. This would probably require adding another method that would return true if only value would be nil:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ndef example_blank?\r\n  self.compact.blank?\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would fix passing `[nil]` to mentioned example, but there would be one another problem: `[nil, \"test\"]`.\r\n\r\nIn given example the only valid method would be always compacting array and then doing all checks on it. Unfortunately we can't do it by default, as nils are still valid values. What we need then is option to compact(or otherwise strip nils) passed parameters. Such method might be for example `to_s`(at least for given example), which would resolve all problems:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ntoken = params[:token].to_s\r\n\r\nunless token.blank?\r\n  user = User.find_by_token(token)\r\n  user.reset_password!\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat is funny this would mark whole CVE-2013-0155 as invalid because it's programmer bug and not framework bug. \r\n\r\nWe could be as secure as we want, but unfortunately sometimes we need to believe in programmer that is producing valid code.

We previously agreed that this is a not the best idea, because 1. it places unreasonable burden on the developer, 2. it exposes internal states of the encoder to #as_json, and 3. it requires everyone along the chain to know what they are doing, otherwise it won't work at all (see #11460 for example).\r\n\r\nSo we agreed it's best to remove circular dependency detection from Object#as_json. The original argument for removing the support from the encoder as well was that Encoder#to_json depends on Encoder#as_json, which in turns depends on Object#as_json. Therefore, if we removed circular protection from Object#as_json and it recurses into an infinite loop, then it wouldn't matter if we have circular protection on the encoder because you'll get a StackError from Object#as_json anyway.\r\n\r\nHowever if people felt that this is too extreme, it would be possible to keep the protection on the encoder, provided that value.as_json itself does not recurse infinitely. (e.g. If `YourClass.new.as_json` returns `[[...]]`, then the encoder could be implemented to correctly detect this circular reference.)\r\n\r\nPersonally, I'm leaning towards we probably shouldn't bother with this (you should never get an infinite loop, the worse thing that could happen is a StackError, which is aliased as CircularRefernceError here). I'll let @jeremy chime in here.","merged":false},{"ts":1377157627000,"body":"There's also the potential confusion. Both SomeClass#as_json and SomeClass#to_json are supposed to raise CircularReferenceError currently (with a lot of edge cases, again see #11460). Since SomeClass#to_json goes through the encoder and SomeClass#as_json does not (anymore), if we leave the protection on the encoder then CircularReferenceError will continue to work on SomeClass#to_json but not SomeClass#as_json. That's \"correct\", but perhaps a confusing change in behaviour, so given the very little benefit (there aren't much to \"protect\" here) I'm not sure if it's worth the trouble.","merged":false},{"ts":1377682658000,"body":"Since I'm still adding more stuff to the branch, closing for now","merged":false}]},{"timestamps":[]},{"timestamps":[{"ts":1373266879000,"body":"Should add [ci skip] to commit message.\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n From: Shinichi Maeshima <notifications@github.com>\nTo: rails/rails <rails@noreply.github.com> \nSent: Sunday, July 7, 2013 11:54 PM\nSubject: [rails] Update 'Active Record Migrations' guide (#11359)\n \n\n\nDelete an unneeded line.\n________________________________\n \nYou can merge this Pull Request by running\ngit pull https://github.com/willnet/rails patch-1\nOr view, comment on, or merge it at:\n  https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11359\nCommit Summary\n\t* Update 'Active Record Migrations' guide\nFile Changes\n\t* M guides/source/migrations.md (1) \nPatch Links:\n\t* https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11359.patch\n\t* https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11359.diff","merged":true},{"ts":1373268168000,"body":"Oh, sorry.

BUT, when you try to invoke `scaffold_controller` directly, the override doesn't work, and rails run original `scaffold_controller`\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, the other solution would be to augment the original `scaffold_controller` to do what we need.

For example as of Rails 4, `.distinct` would do an SQL count, but `.uniq` would load all into memory and use `Array`'s / `Enumerable`'s `uniq`. For your case, there is a method called `.exists?` that uses SQL, and `empty?` seems to map to it, while `blank?` seems not to.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I agree with latest direction of making all commands that have an SQL equivalent use that equivalent, unless the user explicitly states they want Ruby array, such as the latest change that makes `.all` return scope, forcing user to explicitly use `.to_a` if they _really_ want an array. This way novice users won't get burned if they use `.all` because they don't know about `.scoped`.\r\n\r\nSo I **support this change** - IMO all common methods (`.empty?`, `.blank?`, `.any?`, `.uniq`, I'd even go as far as `.select` and `.detect`) should map to their nearest equivalent SQL scope (`.exists?` for `blank?`/`any?`/ `empty?`, `.distinct` for `uniq`, `.where` for `select`, `.where` with `LIMIT 1 `for `.detect` etc.), unless user explicitly does `.to_a`. first. The idea is to make the commands work best for the common case and for the novice user - experienced users who have edge case requirements would figure out how to explicitly cast to array on their own.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMore importantly, however, I think Rails should **pick a direction and stick to it** - either map all common Ruby `Array` / `Enumerable` methods (and their Active Support extensions) to an SQL equivalent if it exists, or map none of them. The case where we map `.empty?` to `.exists?` but not `.blank?`, and similar cases like this, seem like a rather bad discrepancy.\r\n\r\nEdit - realized isn't not quite as simple - `exists?` comes from `Querying` while `blank?` is on `Relation`, but the idea stands.","merged":true},{"ts":1368178985000,"body":"@egilburg It's even more complicated - `uniq` (and `distinct`), when applied to a `CollectionProxy`, return an array (and thus are non-chainable), but for scopes and models return a `Relation`.
